  <div class='nf-center c005'>
    <div>THE STORY OF A FLY-ROD.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c011'>CHAPTER I. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>IN WHICH I INTRODUCE MYSELF.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_5 c018'>I AM called “Old Durability”; but for
fear my name may prove misleading, and
cause those of my readers who are not
acquainted with me to fall into the error of
supposing that I am a very aged article, I
desire to say, at the outset, that I am only four
years old, and that I have been in active
service just sixteen months. During that time
I have seen a world of excitement and adventure,
and have performed some exploits of
which any fly-rod might be justly proud. I
have hooked, at one cast, and successfully
landed, two black bass, weighing together
eight and a quarter pounds; I have so often
been dumped in the cold waters of mountain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>lakes and streams that it is a wonder my ferrules
were not rusted out long ago; I have been
dragged about among snags and lily-pads, by
enraged trout, pickerel and bass; I have been
stolen from my lawful owner, been kept a prisoner
by boys and tramps who either could not
or would not take care of me, and one of my
joints has been broken. Of course, I was skillfully
patched up, but, like the man whose arm
has been fractured, I am not quite as good as I
used to be, and am reluctant to exert all my
strength for fear that I shall break again in the
same place. I can’t throw a fly as far as I
could when I took my finest string of trout in
front of the “sportsmen’s home” at Indian
Lake, and when I am called upon to make the
attempt, my ferrules groan and creak as if they
were about to give away and let me fall to
pieces. For this my master laid me up in
ordinary (that is what sailors say of a war
vessel when she goes out of commission, and is
laid up in port to remain idle there until her
services are needed again), saying, as he did so,
that my days of usefulness were over, but that
he would keep me for the good I had done.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>After having led an active life among the
hills, lakes and forest streams almost ever
since I could remember, you may be sure that
I did not relish treatment of this sort. After
doing my level best for my master, and landing
more than one fish for him that he ought to
have lost because he handled me so awkwardly—after
going with him through some of the most
exciting scenes of his life, and submitting to
treatment that would have used up almost any
other rod, must I be laid upon the shelf in a
dark closet and left to my gloomy reflections,
while a new favorite accompanied my master to
the woods, caught the trout for his dinner,
slept under his blanket, and listened to the
thrilling and amusing stories that were told
around the camp-fire? I resolved to prevent it,
if I could; so when my master took me out of
my case one day to assist him in catching a
muskalonge he had seen in the lake back of his
father’s house, I nerved myself to do valiant
battle, hoping to show him that there was
plenty of good hard work left in me, if he only
knew how to bring it out.</p>

<p class='c019'>The muskalonge, which was lurking in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>edge of the lily-pads ready to pounce upon the
first unwary fish that approached his lair, took
the frog that was on the hook at the very first
cast, and then began the hardest struggle of
my life. My rheumatic joints complained
loudly as the heavy fish darted up and down
the lake, and then dove to the bottom in his
mad efforts to escape, but I held on the best I
knew how until he leaped full length out of the
water, and tried to shake the hook from his
mouth; then I was ready to give up the contest.
He was the largest fish I ever saw.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Scotland’s a burning!” exclaimed Joe.
“Isn’t he a beauty? If this old rod was as
good as he used to be, wouldn’t I have a prize
in a few minutes from now?”</p>

<p class='c019'>I ought to have told you before that my
master’s name is Joe Wayring; and a right
good boy he is, too, as you will find before my
story is ended. Nearly all the young fellows
of my acquaintance, and I know some of the
best there are in the country, have some favorite
word or expression which always rises to
their lips whenever they are surprised, excited
or angry, and the words I have just quoted are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>the ones Joe always used under such circumstances.
No matter how exasperated he was
you never could get any thing stronger out of
him.</p>

<p class='c019'>I will not dwell upon the particulars of that
fight (my joints ache yet whenever I think of
it), for I set out to talk about other matters. It
will be enough to say that I held fast to the
fish until he became exhausted and was drawn
through the lily-pads to the bank; then the
gaff-hook came to my assistance, and he was
safely landed. He was a monster. I afterward
learned that he weighed a trifle over nineteen
pounds. Wasn’t that something of an exploit
for an eight ounce rod who had been threatened
with the retired list on account of supposed
disability? I was so nearly doubled up
by the long-continued strain that had been
brought to bear upon me, that when my master
threw me down on the ground while he gave his
prize his quietus with the heavy handle of the
gaff-hook, I could not immediately straighten
out again, as every well-conditioned rod is
expected to do under similar circumstances.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why, what in the world have you got
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>there?” cried Joe’s mother, as the boy entered
the kitchen, carrying me in one hand and dragging
the fish after him with the other. She
seemed to be a little afraid of the young fisherman’s
prize, and that was hardly to be wondered
at, for his mouth was open, and it was
full of long, sharp teeth.</p>

<p class='c019'>“It’s the biggest muskalonge that was ever
caught in this lake,” replied Joe, as he laid me
down upon a chair and took both hands to
deposit his fish upon the table. “Didn’t he
fight, though? I say, Uncle Joe,” he added,
addressing himself to a dignified gentleman in
spectacles, who just then came into the
room with the morning’s paper in his hand,
“I shall not need that new split bamboo you
promised me for my birthday, though I thank
you for your kind offer, all the same. This old
rod is good for at least one more summer on
Indian Lake. There is plenty of back-bone left
in him yet.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Uncle Joe was a rich old bachelor and very
fond of his namesake, Joe Wayring, on whom
he lavished all the affection he would have
given to his own children, if he had had any.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>He was an enthusiastic angler, a skillful and
untiring bear and deer hunter, and he generally
timed his trips to the woods and mountains so
that Joe and some of his particular friends
could go with him.</p>

<p class='c019'>“He is the most durable rod I ever saw,”
added my master.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, then, call him ‘Old Durability’,”
suggested Uncle Joe.</p>

<p class='c019'>The boy said he thought that name would
just suit me, and from that day to this I have
been known by every one who is acquainted
with me as “Old Durability”.</p>

<p class='c019'>Having introduced myself, because there was
no one to perform the ceremony for me, and
told you how I came by my cognomen, I will
now go back and relate how I made the
acquaintance of my master, Joe Wayring.</p>

<p class='c019'>If you will review your own life, boy reader,
you may be able to find in it some incident,
which happened, perhaps, long before you
were out of pinafores, and which you remember
perfectly, while all your life previous to the
occurrence of that particular incident is a blank
to you. Just so it was in my own experience.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>When I first came to my senses, I found myself
snugly tied up in my case and standing in a
corner, looking through a glass door into a
large store in which guns of all makes and fishing
tackle of all kinds were kept for sale. At first
I was greatly bewildered. I felt, if I may judge
from what I have seen during my trips to the
woods, like a boy who has just awakened from
a sound sleep; but after a while my wits came
to me, and then I found that I was not alone in
the show-case. There were a dozen or two fly
and bait rods standing in the corner beside me,
and a little further down, looking toward the
back end of the store, were single and double-barreled
shot-guns, muzzle and breech-loading
rifles, game-bags, creels, hunting knives, dog-whips,
and almost every thing else that a sportsman
is supposed to need. In the show-case,
which rested on the long counter in front of
me, were revolvers, pen-knives, lines, leaders,
flies and ordinary fish-hooks without number;
and on the opposite side of the store was an
array of barrels containing glass balls, traps for
throwing those balls, bicycles, tricycles, rowing
and lifting machines—in fact, I saw so many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>things that I did not then know the name or
use of, that I became confused while I looked
at them.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Hallo, there! Have you waked up at last?”
cried a voice, breaking in upon my meditations.</p>

<p class='c019'>A short investigation showed that the voice
came from the case that stood next on my
right. I did not know, of course, what sort of
a rod he was, or whether or not he would prove
to be an agreeable acquaintance; but wishing
to be civil, I replied that I <i>had</i> waked up, and
that, if he could tell me, I should be glad to
know where I was and how I came there.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why, you are in a one-horse country town,
a thousand miles from nowhere, and you have
always been here,” was the answer, given as I
thought in a tone of contempt. “I have traveled.
I came all the way from New York.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Who are you?” I ventured to ask; for my
new acquaintance spoke in so dignified and
lofty a tone, that I stood somewhat in awe of
him.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I am a split bamboo,” said he; and then I
saw very clearly that he was disposed to throw
on airs, and to lord it over those who were not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>as fortunate as himself. “I am a gentleman’s
rod, and it takes the ducats to buy me. I am
worth forty-five dollars; while I see by the
card tied to your case, that you are valued at
only six and a half.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Not being quick at figures at this early period
of my life, I could not tell just how much
difference there was between forty-five dollars
and six and a half, but I knew by the way the
bamboo spoke, that the gulf that separated
him from me was a wide one. I have learned
some things since then. I know now that the
qualities of a fly-rod do not depend upon the
varnish that is put on the outside of him, any
more than a boy’s qualities of mind and heart
depend upon the clothes he wears. The stuff
he is made of and the company he keeps have
much to do with the record he makes in the
world. While I was turning the matter over
in my mind, somebody who had been listening
to our conversation, suddenly broke in with:</p>

<p class='c019'>“You are neither one of you worth the
money you cost.”</p>

<p class='c019'>I looked around to see who the new speaker
was, and presently discovered him in the person
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>of a handsome bird gun, who rested upon a pair
of deer’s antlers a short distance away.</p>

<p class='c019'>“You can’t bring a squirrel out of the top of
the tallest hickory in the woods, or stop a
woodcock or a grouse on the wing, but I can,”
continued the double-barrel.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I can catch a trout, if I have some one to
back me who understands his business, and
that’s more than you can do,” retorted the
bamboo, spitefully. “I can throw a line sixty
or seventy feet; I heard the proprietor of this
store say so.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“And I can throw shot sixty or seventy
yards, which is three times as far as you can
throw a line,” shouted the double-barrel.
“You seem to think yourself of some consequence
because you came from New York. I
came all the way from England, and that is on
the other side of the ocean.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“So you are an assisted immigrant, are
you?” cried the bamboo, in tones indicative of
the greatest contempt. “Well, that’s all I
care to know about you.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The disputants grew more and more in
earnest the longer they talked, and pretty soon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>there were some hard words used. I took no
part in the controversy, for I felt rather bashful
in the presence of those who had seen so
much more of the world than I had, and who
were worth so much more money, and besides
I could not see what there was to quarrel about.
My sympathies were with the bamboo, arrogant
as he had showed himself to be, because he was
an American like myself; but still the English
fowling-piece, “assisted immigrant” though
he was, had a right to live in this country so
long as he behaved himself, and as he was a
showy fellow, I had no doubt that he would get
out of the store before either the bamboo or
myself. And so he did. While the dispute
was at its height the door opened and a young
man came in—a tall young man, with very thin
legs, peaked shoes, gold eye-glasses and a
downy upper lip. He walked with a mincing
step and drawled out his words when he talked.</p>

<p class='c019'>“A dude!” whispered the bamboo.</p>

<p class='c019'>Before I could ask what a “dude” was, the
proprietor came up, and the talking was for a
moment hushed. Being impatient to be
released from the show-case so that we could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>see what was going on in the great world outside,
each one of us cherished the secret hope
that we might find favor in the eyes of the prospective
purchaser. We were so inexperienced
and foolish that we didn’t care much who
bought us, so long as we got out.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I—aw! I want to look at a nice light bird
gun,” said the young man; “something you
can recommend for woodcock and the like,
don’t yer know?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why, that’s a countryman of mine,” exclaimed
the double-barrel, who seemed to be
highly excited by the discovery.</p>

<p class='c019'>The bamboo hastened to assure me that he
wasn’t—that he was an American trying to ape
English ways.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Do you want a hammerless?” asked the
proprietor.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I—aw! They come pretty ’igh, don’t they?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Not necessarily. Here’s one worth a hundred
and twenty-five dollars,” replied the storekeeper;
and as he spoke, he opened the show-case
and took from it a double-barrel who was so
very plain in appearance, that I had not before
taken more than a passing glance at him. “I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>judge from your speech that you are an Englishman,
and if you are, you of course know
more about this make of guns than I can tell
you. It is a Greener.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The young man seemed pleased to know that
he had succeeded in making the proprietor believe
that he was not an American, but he did
not seem to appreciate the gun, nor did he
handle it as if he were accustomed to the use
of fire-arms. He hardly knew how to bring it
to his face properly.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I—aw! Hit’s wery fine, no doubt,” said
he, after he had made an awkward pretense of
examining the gun, “but I—aw! I want something
a little more showy and not quite so
’igh-priced, don’t yer know? Something that
I can take pride in exhibiting to my ’unting
friends, don’t yer know?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“We have guns that are more showy than
this, but they are cheap affairs, and we don’t
recommend them. How would this one suit
you?” said the proprietor; and as he spoke,
he opened another door in the show-case, and
took my bragging friend down from his place
on the antlers.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>It may have been all imagination on my part,
but I would have been willing to affirm that his
nickel-plated ornaments grew a shade dimmer
as he was taken out of the case, and I am of the
same opinion still. By his boasting he had led
us all to believe that he was worth at least two
or three hundred dollars; and you can imagine
how surprised we were when we learned that
he was valued at a very small fraction of that
sum.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Aw! That looks more like a gun,” said the
customer. “That’s a piece, don’t yer know,
that a fellah can show to his friends. Hit’ll
shoot, I suppose?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh, yes, it will shoot, but it will not do as
clean work as the one I just showed you.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Hi’ll take the risk. ’Ow much for ’im?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Twenty-five dollars; and that includes a
trunk-shaped case, loading-tools, wiping-rod
and fifty brass-shells.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The young man handed over the money and
went out, after requesting that his purchase
might be sent up to the Lambert House at
once, as he wished to start for the woods on
the following day. As soon as the door was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>closed behind him, the proprietor called out to
the porter:</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh, Rube! Come here and take this Brummagem
shooting-iron up to the hotel. Thank
goodness it is the last one we have in stock,
and I’ll never buy another.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I wonder how that boastful bird gun feels
now,” whispered the bamboo. “His pride had
to take a tumble, didn’t it? There’s no Brummagem
about me, I can tell you.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“What do you mean by—by—” The word
was too hard for me, and I stumbled over it.</p>

<p class='c019'>“By Brummagem?” said the bamboo, who
felt so good over the discomfiture of the English
fowling-piece that he was disposed to be
friendly as well as civil. “Why, it’s something
that is fine and showy, but which is not
in reality worth any thing. A Yankee would
say that that double-barrel was a ‘shoddy’
article.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I feel guilty every time I sell one of those
guns,” continued the proprietor. “They are
made in Birmingham, England, at the cost of
nine dollars apiece by the dozen.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“That dude will never hurt any thing with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>it,” observed the porter, who had taken a good
look at the customer and heard all that passed
between him and his employer.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I hope he will not hurt himself with it,”
answered the latter. “What does he want to
go into the woods for? He doesn’t know a
woodcock from an ostrich.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“He goes because it is fashionable, I suppose,”
said Rube; and I afterward found out
that that was just the reason. I saw him in
the wilderness a few weeks later, and had an
opportunity to exchange a word or two with
the Brummagem breech-loader. The latter
looked decidedly seedy. He was covered with
rust, his locks were out of order, and he had
been put to such hard service that every joint
in his make-up was loose. The second time I
met him he could scarcely talk to me, because
there was not much left of him except his
stock. His ignorant owner—but we’ll wait
until we come to that, won’t we?</p>

<p class='c019'>The next customers who came into the store
were an elderly gentleman and a young lady.
I certainly thought my chance for freedom had
come, for when the gentleman said that his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>daughter wanted to look at a fly-rod, something
light enough to be managed with one
hand, and strong enough to land a perch or
rock-bass, the proprietor pushed open the door
in front of me and took me out.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Aha!” exclaimed the bamboo. “Your
fate is to be the companion and plaything of a
little girl, who will probably set you to catching
sunfish and minnows, and throw you down
in the mud when she gets through with you.
I know that I am destined for the trout streams,
and I have an idea that I shall be taken to
Canada to have a shy at the lordly salmon.
Good-by; but I am sorry for you.”</p>

<p class='c019'>I did not thank the bamboo for his words of
sympathy, because I did not believe they were
sincere. I thought I could detect a hypocritical
twang in them; but before I could tell him
so, I was taken out of my case, and for the
first time given an opportunity to see how I
looked.</p>

<p class='c019'>“There is a rod I can recommend. Lancewood
throughout, nickel-plated ferrules and
reel-seat and artistically wound with cane and
silk,” said the proprietor, glibly. “I will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>warrant him to do good work, and if the lady
breaks him she will not be much out of pocket—only
six dollars and a half.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh, I don’t want a cheap thing like that,”
exclaimed the young lady, who would not take
a second look at me after she heard that I was
worth so little money. “I want a nice rod.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The storekeeper laid me on the show-case,
and brought my friend the split bamboo out
for exhibition. He was a splendid looking fellow,
and I did not wonder that the young lady
went into ecstasies over him, and declared at
once that he was just the rod she had long been
wishing for. Neither could I resist the temptation
to say to him, as he was put back into his
case:</p>

<p class='c019'>“What do you think now of your chances
of going among the trout streams and of taking
a shy at the lordly salmon! Good-by; but I
am sorry for you.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The bamboo was so crest-fallen that he could
make no response. He was carried away by
his new owner, and I did not see him again
until I was almost ready to be laid upon the
shelf in my master’s closet, to enjoy a long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>winter’s rest after a season of the hardest kind
of work. The pride and arrogance were all
gone out of him, and he did not look much as
he did when he left the store. If he had been
a man, folks would have called him a tramp.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_5 c018'>THE bamboo having been disposed of I was
returned to the show-case, where I spent
two very lonely days. The rods around me
were worth more money than I was, and feeling
their importance they would scarcely speak
to me, even to answer a civil question; so all I
could do was to hold my peace and listen to
their conversation. But fate had decreed that
I should not long remain a captive. One afternoon
there came into the store a gentleman in
gold spectacles, accompanied by two bright
boys about fifteen years of age. They must
have been well known to the proprietor, for he
shook their hands with all the cordiality which
shopkeepers know how to assume toward their
rich patrons, and greeted them with:</p>

<p class='c019'>“Ah, colonel, I am glad to see you. Well,
Joseph, have you come after that rod?”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>“Yes, sir,” answered one of the boys, a
curly-headed, blue-eyed lad, who looked so
good-natured and jolly that I took a great
fancy to him at once. “You remember what
I told you the last time I was here, Mr. Brown—that
I want something light and strong and
inexpensive. I can’t afford to pay a high price
for a rod that I may break at the very first
cast. You know I never threw a fly in my life.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Yes, I know that,” said Mr. Brown, “and
I know, too, that as a bait fisher you have
few equals and no superiors among boys of
your age.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I thank you for the compliment, but I am
afraid I don’t deserve it,” said the blue-eyed
boy, modestly.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh, yes, you do. Now here’s a rod that
will suit you exactly,” answered the proprietor,
pushing open the show-case and laying
hold of me. “He weighs only eight ounces,
hangs beautifully, and will answer your purpose
as well as one worth five times the money.
Only six and a half, and that’s cheaper than
you could steal him, if you were in that line of
business.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>“What do you say, Uncle Joe?” asked the
boy after he and his companion, whom he
addressed as Roy Sheldon, had shaken me up
and down in the air until it was a wonder to
me that they did not break my back.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Since Mr. Brown has recommended him,
I say that you can’t do better than to take
him,” was the reply, and that settled the matter.
I had a master at last, and a good one,
too, if there were any faith to be put in appearances.
I took him for a restless, uneasy fellow
who would not let me rust for want of use, and
I found that I had not been mistaken in my
opinion of him.</p>

<p class='c019'>Joe, as I shall hereafter call him, next purchased,
under his uncle’s supervision, three
long water-proof lines, a Loomis automatic
reel, a dozen cream-colored leaders of different
lengths, a creel who afterward became my constant
companion, and a fly-book filled with all
the most tempting lures known to anglers,
such as coachmen, white millers, red and
brown hackles, and many other things whose
names I did not know. With these under his arm
and me on his shoulder he set out for home
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>accompanied by Roy Sheldon, Uncle Joe taking
leave of them at the door, saying that he
was going to the post-office.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I wish every fellow in the world had an
uncle like that,” said Joe, as he turned about
and waved his hand to the gentleman with the
gold spectacles.</p>

<p class='c019'>“So do I,” answered Roy, “excepting, of
course, Tom Bigden and his crowd.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I don’t except even them,” said Joe.
“Tom pulls a lovely oar, and I never saw a
fellow who could play short stop or train a
spaniel like him. I have nothing against any
of them, and should be glad to be friends with
them if they would let me.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“But haven’t you seen to your satisfaction
that they won’t let you?” demanded Roy,
rather sharply. “They’ve got something
against you, and they’ll continue to make you
suffer for it; see if they don’t.”</p>

<p class='c019'>I wondered what it was that any one could
have against so fine a young fellow as my
new master appeared to be, and it was not
many days before I found out. Tom Bigden
and his followers <i>did</i> make Joe suffer, but it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>was principally through his friends, that
is, through his sail-boat, his shell in which he
used to train for his races, his canvas canoe that
had carried him safely down the most difficult
rapids in Indian River, and finally through me.
In fact, I became a regular shuttle-cock of fortune,
and was so roughly knocked about from
pillar to post, that it is a wonder to me that I
am as good a rod as I am.</p>

<p class='c019'>After a few minutes’ walk along a quiet street
shaded on each side by grand old trees, Joe and
his companion turned into a wide carriage-way
which led them by a circuitous route through
a little grove of evergreens to the house in which
Joe lived—a fine brick mansion, with stone
facings, a carriage-porch at the side door, and
a croquet ground and lawn tennis court in
front. Behind the house the grounds sloped
gently down to the shore of a beautiful lake,
with an island near the center, and with banks
on each side that were thickly wooded, save
where the trees and undergrowth had been
cleared away to make room for the cozy summer
residences of the visitors who came there
every year. For Mount Airy, that was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>name of the village in which Joe Wayring
lived, was acquiring some fame as a watering
place. There were four springs in the vicinity,
whose waters were supposed to possess
some medicinal virtues, the scenery was grand,
the drives numerous and pleasant, and the
fishing (and the shooting, too, in the proper
season), could not be surpassed.</p>

<p class='c019'>At the foot of the path that led from the
carriage-porch to the lake, was a boat-house
which afforded shelter to some of Joe’s friends
whose acquaintance I was soon to make, and a
short distance from its door his sail boat, the
<i>Young Republic</i>, rode at her moorings. It
was indeed a pleasant scene that was spread
out before me; but before I had time to
admire it sufficiently, Joe and his companion
went up the stone steps three at a jump,
rushed into the hall, fired their caps at the hat-rack,
and without waiting to see whether or
not they caught on the pegs at which they were
aimed, ran up the wide stairs that led to the
floor above. I held my breath in suspense and
wondered what in the world was the matter
now; but I afterward learned that I had no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>cause for uneasiness, and that that is the way
boys generally conduct themselves when they
go into a house. It saves them the trouble of
hunting up their father and mother and telling
them that they have got home without being
run over by the cars, or knocked down by a
runaway horse, or drowned in the lake.</p>

<p class='c019'>The room into which Joe conducted his
friend was like the private sanctum of every
other boy who delights in the sports of the woods
and fields, with this exception: It was in
perfect order, and as neat as a new pin. Joe’s
mother wouldn’t have it any other way, and
neither would Joe. Indeed it was a favorite
saying of his that if folks would keep away
and let his things alone (by “folks” he meant
to designate old Betty, the housekeeper, who,
according to Joe’s way of thinking, was “awful
fussy”), he could find any thing he wanted,
from a postage-stamp to a spoon-oar, on the
darkest of nights, and without a lamp to aid
him in the search.</p>

<p class='c019'>The room looked a good deal like a museum
I afterward saw, only it was on a much smaller
scale, of course, and it contained so many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>rare and curious things that Joe’s friends
were always glad of an invitation “to step
up for a few minutes.” Uncle Joe’s love
for the rod and gun had led him to roam all
over his own country, as well as to some remote
corners of foreign lands, and during these rambles
he never forgot the boy at home who
thought so much of relics and souvenirs of all
kinds, and took such good care of them. He
gave Joe the Alpine stock which had assisted
him in his ascent of Mount Blanc; the Indian
saddle and bridle he had used when fleeing
from the agency at the time the Utes rose in
rebellion and killed Meeker and all the other
whites who did not succeed in making good
their escape; the head of the first bison he
had ever shot, and which, having been mounted
by an expert taxidermist, had been hung above
the looking-glass over the mantle to serve as
a resting place for the sword and pistols Uncle
Joe carried during the war, the elk-horn bow,
quiver of arrows, scalping knife and moccasins
presented to him by a Sioux chief; and for the
prize lancewood bow won by my master at a
shooting match; for Joe was an archer, as well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>as an angler and wing shot, and he had been
Master Bowman of the Mount Airy Toxophilites
until he became tired of the office and gave
it up. These articles, and a good many others
which I did not have time to look at, were so
neatly and artistically arranged that it did not
seem to me that a single one of them could be
moved without spoiling the effect of the whole.
Nothing looked out of place, not even the
black, uncouth object that lay in a little
recess on the opposite side of the room. Having
never seen any thing just like him before, I
could not make out what he was, and I waited
rather impatiently for his master to go out of
the room so that I could speak to him; but Joe
did not seem to be in any hurry to leave. He
stood me up in a corner, and then he and Roy
seated themselves at a table in the middle of
the room, and proceeded to “fix up” a debate
that was to be held at the High School on the
afternoon of the coming Friday. The question
was: “Ought corporal punishment in
schools to be abolished?” No doubt it was a
matter in which both Joe and Roy had been
deeply interested in their younger days, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>it did not affect me one way or the other, and
consequently I paid very little attention to
what they said. My time was fully taken up
with the strange things I saw around me.</p>

<p class='c019'>At last, to my great satisfaction, the boys
concluded that they could “fix up” the matter
while sailing about the lake in the <i>Young
Republic</i>, better than they could while sitting
by the table, especially if they could find some
boat to race with, so they bolted out of the room
with much noise and racket, and left the house,
banging the hall door loudly behind them.
Then I turned to speak to the object that occupied
the recess on the other side of the room,
and found that he was quite as willing to make
my acquaintance as I was to make his.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Hallo!” said he; and I afterward learned
that that is the way in which school boys and
telephones always greet each other.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Hallo!” said I, in reply. “Who are you?
if I may be so bold as to inquire.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh, that’s all right,” answered my new
acquaintance, cheerfully. “Everybody who
sees me for the first time wants to know all
about me. I don’t suppose I am much to look
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>at—indeed, I know I am not, because I can see
my reflection in the mirror over the mantle—but
I am the boss boat on the rapids, and am
worth more on a ‘carry’ than all the cedar and
birch-bark canoes in America. I am the historian
of the Wayring family, or, rather, of the
youngest branch of it,” he added, with no little
pride in his tones. “I carry secrets enough to
sink any ordinary craft, and if I only had the
power to communicate some of them to my
master, perhaps he wouldn’t open his eyes! I
am a canvas canoe, at your service.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh!” said I.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Yes,” said he. “And unless my judgment
is at fault, you are a fly-rod. I heard Joe say
that his uncle was going to get one for him.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“That is just what I am,” I made answer.
“Nickel-plated ferrules and reel-seat, artistically
wound with cane and silk, and lancewood
throughout.”</p>

<p class='c019'>My lofty speech did not have the effect I
thought it would. The canvas canoe seemed
to have rather an exalted opinion of himself,
and I did not see why I should stay in the
background for want of somebody to praise me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>and so I praised myself; and that’s a bad thing
to do. I only succeeded in exciting the merriment
of every occupant of the room, for I heard
derisive laughter on all sides of me.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Don’t throw on airs, young fellow,” said
the canvas canoe, as soon as he could speak.
“You have come to the wrong shop for that
sort of work. I wouldn’t boast until I had done
something, if I were in your place. If there is
any good in you, you will fare well in Joe’s
hands, and he will do your bragging for you;
but if you fail him when the pinch comes, you
will most likely be chucked into the lake, or
given away to the first little ragamuffin he can
find who wants a rod that is good for nothing.
So take a friend’s advice and hold your tongue
until you have seen service.”</p>

<p class='c019'>I felt somewhat abashed by this rebuke, for,
of course, I was desirous of making a favorable
impression upon those with whom I was to be
associated all the days of my life. I thought I
had made them despise me; but the next words
uttered by the canvas canoe showed me that I
need have no fears on that score.</p>

<p class='c019'>“A boat and a rod generally go together,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>you know,” said he; “so I suppose that you
and I will see much of each other hereafter.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“And how about me?” piped a shrill voice
close beside me.</p>

<p class='c019'>I looked down, and there was the creel. I
had not thought of him before, and it was plain
that the canoe hadn’t either, for he exclaimed,
in a tone of surprise:</p>

<p class='c019'>“Who spoke? Oh, it was you, was it?
Well, I don’t know just what Joe will do with
you, for he never owned a creel before. He has
always carried his dinner in his pocket when
he went trouting, or in a basket if he went out
on the lake after bass, and brought his fish
home on a string; but he will find use for you,
you may depend upon that. He is a busy boy,
is Joe, and he keeps every body around him
busy, too.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I understood you to say that you are the
historian of the Wayring family,” I ventured
to remark, when the canoe ceased speaking.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Of the youngest branch of it—yes. I have
been a member of this household for a long
time. Can’t you see that I am a veteran?
Don’t you notice my wounds? I have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>snagged more times than I can remember, I
have had holes punched in me by rocks, and
some of my ribs have been fractured; but I am
a pretty good boat yet. At least Joe thinks so,
for he is going to take me somewhere this
coming summer, probably up into Michigan to
run the rapids of the Menominee; and, to tell
you the honest truth, I am looking forward to
that trip with fear and trembling. I have heard
Uncle Joe say that those rapids were something
to make a man’s hair stand on end; but if my
master says ‘go’, I shall take him through if
I can. I have carried him through some dangerous
places, and whenever I have got him
into trouble, it has been owing to his own carelessness
or mismanagement.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I suppose he thinks a great deal of you?”
said I.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, he ought to,” replied the canoe, with
a self-satisfied air. “I have stuck to him
through thick and thin for a good many years.
I was the very first plaything he owned, after
he took it into his head that he was getting too
big to ride a rocking-horse. He used to paddle
me around on a duck pond, where the water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>wasn’t more than a foot deep, long before it
was thought safe to trust him with a rod or
gun. But Joe does not seem to care much for
a gun. He is fairly carried away by his love of
archery, and a long bow is his favorite weapon.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Do you know who Tom Bigden is, and what
Joe has done to incur his ill-will?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I have some slight acquaintance with that
young gentleman,” answered the canoe, with a
laugh. “It was through him that I was snagged
and sunk in the Indian Lake country. I don’t
know how the fuss started, and neither does
any body except Tom Bigden himself; but I
suppose that fellow over there and a few others
like him, are wholly to blame for it.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“What fellow? Over where?” I asked;
for of course the canvas canoe could not point
his finger or nod his head to tell me which way
to look.</p>

<p class='c019'>“This fellow up here,” said a new voice,
which came from over the bookcase.</p>

<p class='c019'>I looked up, and there was another lancewood
bow, resting on a pair of deer’s antlers.
He was not quite as fancy as the prize bow of
whom I have already spoken. His green plush
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>handle was beginning to look threadbare, and
that, to my mind, indicated that he had seen
service.</p>

<p class='c019'>“You wouldn’t think that a few insignificant
things like that could be the means of setting
a whole village together by the ears, would
you?” continued the canoe.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Insignificant yourself,” retorted the long
bow; but I was glad to notice that he did not
speak as if he were angry. The various articles
I saw about me all cherished the most friendly
feelings for one another, but when they had
nothing to do, they were like a lot of idle boys—always
trying to “get a joke” upon some of
their number. “You never won a prize for Joe,
did you? Well, I have. Go and win a race
before you brag. You can’t; you’re much too
clumsy. One of those Shadow or Rob Roy
canoes out there on the lake would beat you
out of sight in going a mile.”</p>

<p class='c019'>I cared nothing at all for this side sparring.
I knew that I would have plenty of time in
which to listen to it during the long winter
months, when canoe, long bow and fly-rod
would be laid up in ordinary, while skates,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>snow-shoes and toboggans took our places in
the affections of our master for the time being.
For I saw snow-shoes and a toboggan there, and
I knew what they were, because I had seen some
like them in Mr. Brown’s store. They came
from Canada, and were almost as full of stories
as the canoe was. Joe had worn the snow-shoes
while hunting caribou in Newfoundland
in company with his uncle, and the toboggan
had carried his master with lightning speed
over the ice bridge at Niagara Falls. Many an
hour that would otherwise have dragged by on
leaden wings did they brighten for us by relating
scraps of their personal history, and at some
future time I may induce them to put those
same narratives into print for your benefit;
but just now we are interested in Tom Bigden.
We want to know why he disliked Joe Wayring,
and what made him take every opportunity
he could find to annoy him.</p>

<p class='c019'>“When you talk about racing you don’t
want to leave me out,” observed the toboggan,
“for I am the lad to show speed. Give me a
fair field, and I would not be much afraid to
try conclusions with an express train. And it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>takes as much, if not more, skill to manage me
than it does to handle an awkward canvas
canoe, who is always bobbing about, turning
first one way and then another as if he were
too contrary to hold a straight course.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I wasn’t intended for a racing boat, and I
know I can’t compete with such flyers as you
and a Rob Roy,” said the canvas canoe,
modestly; and I afterward found that none of
my new acquaintances were half as conceited
as they pretended to be. They boasted just to
hear themselves talk, and because they had no
other way of passing the time when they were
unemployed; but each was perfectly willing
to acknowledge the superiority of the other in
his own particular line of business. “I was
intended for a portable craft—something that
can be folded into a small compass and carried
over a portage without much trouble; and in
that respect I am far ahead of a stiff-necked
Canuck, who, having made up his mind just
how much space he ought to occupy in the
world, would rather break than bend to give
elbow-room to his betters.” “You wanted me
to tell you something about Tom Bigden, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>believe,” added the canoe, addressing himself
to me. “Well, it is a long story, but you will
have plenty of time to listen to it; for if Joe
and Roy have gone out on the lake, they will
not return much before dark. You ought to
know the full history of Tom’s dealings with
Joe, for you may become the victim of persecution
as the rest of us are and have been ever
since Tom came here; and if you were not
posted, you would not know how to account
for it. A long time ago—”</p>

<p class='c019'>But there! I never could learn to tell a
story in the words of another, so I will, for a
time, drop the personal pronoun, which I don’t
like to use if I can help it, and give you in my
own homely way the substance of the narrative
to which I listened that afternoon. But please
understand one thing before I begin: The
historian was not a personal witness of all the
incidents I am about to describe. He couldn’t
have been, unless he possessed the power of
being in half a dozen different places at the
same time. He saw and heard some things, of
course, but much of his information had been
obtained from the long bow, and from Joe and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>his friends, who had freely discussed matters
in his presence; and by putting all these
different incidents together, he was able to
make up a story which, to me, was very
interesting. I hope it may prove so to you.</p>

  <h2 class='c011'>CHAPTER III. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>SOMETHING ABOUT TOM BIGDEN AND HIS COUSINS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c018'>MOUNT AIRY, the village in which Joe
Wayring and Roy Sheldon lived, was
situated a few miles away from a large city
which, for want of a better name, we will call
New London. It was so far distant from the
city that it could not properly be spoken of as
one of its suburbs, and yet the railroad brought
the village so near to it that a good many men
who did business in New London, Joe’s father
and Roy’s among the number, had their homes
there. It was a veritable “hide and seek
town”. Sometimes, as you were approaching
it on the cars, you would see it very plainly,
and then again you wouldn’t. It was nestled
in among high mountains, and in the woods
which covered them from base to summit
could be found an abundance of small game,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>such as hares, squirrels and grouse, that
afforded sport to the local Nimrods, and even
received attention from the New London gunners.
It was surrounded by a perfect network
of babbling trout brooks, and there were
several lakes and ponds in the vicinity in which
some of the finest fish in the world awaited the
lure of the skillful angler. And it required
skill to take them, too. They were shy of
strangers, and it wasn’t every body who could
go out in the morning and come back at night
with a full creel.</p>

<p class='c019'>Nor was larger game wanting to tempt the
hunter who plumed himself on being a good
shot with the rifle. Visitors standing upon
the veranda of the principal hotel in the
village had often heard wolves howling in the
mountains, and on more than one occasion a
deer had been seen standing on the opposite
shore of Mirror Lake (it was generally called
Wayring’s Lake, because Joe’s father owned
the land on all sides of it), regarding with much
curiosity the evidences of civilization that had
sprung up on the other side. More than that,
a bear was expected to make his appearance at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>least once every season; and when word was
passed that he was in sight, what a hubbub it
created among the visiting sportsmen! How
prompt they were to seize their guns and run out
after him, and how sure they were to come back
empty-handed! Uncle Joe used to say that he
believed the managers of the hotels would close
their doors against the man who was lucky
enough to shoot that bear, for unless Bruin
had a companion to take his place, his death
would spoil their advertisements. For years
the proprietor of the Mount Airy House had
been accustomed to tell the public, through the
New London papers, that bear could be seen
from the piazza of his hotel, and the announcement
had brought him many a dollar from
sportsmen who came from all parts of the country
to shoot that bear. Why didn’t Uncle Joe
shoot him? He owned the hotel.</p>

<p class='c019'>We have said that Mount Airy was acquiring
some fame as a watering-place; but that
must not lead you to infer that it was like
other places of resort—lively enough in summer,
but very dull in winter, for such was by
no means the case. The village was lively at all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>seasons of the year. Of course there were many
more people there in summer than there were in
winter, for during warm weather the hotels
and all the boarding houses were crowded with
visitors, and so were the cottages on the other
side of the lake; but when these visitors went
away, the citizens did not hibernate like so
many woodchucks and wait for them to come
back, because they were not dependent upon
tourists either for their livelihood or for means
of entertainment. Strangers were astonished
when they found what a driving, go-ahead sort
of people they were. They were proud of their
village, of its churches, its hotels, its fine private
residences, and its high-school was so well
and favorably known that it attracted students
from all parts of the country. It could boast
of an efficient fire department, composed of all
the leading men in town (the ministers and
teachers, to a man, belonged to it), a military
company which formed a part of the National
Guard of the State, and a band of archers known
as the Mount Airy Toxophilites. We ought,
rather, to say that there were <i>two</i> bands of
archers, one being composed of boys and girls,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>and the other of their fathers, mothers and
older brothers and sisters. They were both
uniformed, but the boy members of the
Toxophilites were the only ones who ever
paraded.</p>

<p class='c019'>It was worth a long journey to see these
forty young archers turn out and march
through the streets to the music of the band.
They looked as neat in their green and white
suits, with short top boots, and black hats
turned up at one side and fastened with a
black feather, as the military company did in
their blue uniforms and white helmets: and as
for their marching, it was nearly perfect. They
had a manual of arms which originated with
Uncle Joe, who, for more than a year, acted as
their instructor and drill-master. They were
governed by a constitution and by-laws, and
fines were imposed upon those who did not
turn out regularly to the drills and parades.
They had shooting matches at which prizes
were distributed, also a grand annual hunt,
followed by a dinner that was equally grand;
and every year some of the boys spent a week
or two camping in the mountains, taking bows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>and arrows with them instead of guns. A good
many of the young archers were very fine shots
with these novel weapons, and there were
about half a dozen of them, of whom Joe and
Roy made two, who stood ready at any time
to meet an equal number of riflemen at the
trap, the archers shooting at twelve yards rise
and the riflemen at twenty.</p>

<p class='c019'>On the morning of July 4, 18—, a large
party of newly-arrived visitors were seated on
the wide veranda of the Mount Airy House,
enjoying the refreshing breeze that came to
them from over the lake, and congratulating
themselves on having left the city, with all its
dust, heat and noise, behind them for one good
long month at least. Some of these visitors
had never been there before, and consequently
they knew little or nothing about the village
and its inhabitants. Among these were Tom
Bigden and his two cousins, Ralph and Loren
Farnsworth, who were leaning over the railing,
fanning their flushed faces with their
hats, and wondering how in the world they
were going to put in four weeks’ time in that
desolate town. They were city boys, any body
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>could see that, and they were disappointed, and
angry as well, because their parents had
not decided to spend a portion of the summer at
some place convenient to salt water, so that
they could enjoy a dip in the surf now and then.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I see a boat down there,” observed Loren.
“I wonder if we could hire it for an hour or
two? I think I should like to take a sail on
that lake, it looks so cool and inviting.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Humph!” exclaimed Tom. “I’d much
rather take a run up to Newport or over to
Greenbush in my father’s yacht.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I wouldn’t,” answered Loren. “I can go
down to the Sound any day, but a gem of a lake
like this is something I haven’t feasted my eyes
upon in a long time. I am going to see if I can
hire a boat; and after I get tired of sailing
around in her, I’m going to lie to under the
shade of some tree that hangs over the water,
and be as lazy as I know how. That’s what I
came up here for.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Boom!” said a field-piece, from some distant
part of the village.</p>

<p class='c019'>“What was that?” exclaimed Ralph. “A
cannon?”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“Naw,” replied Tom, in a tone which implied
that he had no patience with any one who could
ask such a question. “What would a cannon be
doing up here in the woods? Do you think
these greenhorns are going to try to get up a
celebration for our benefit?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“No, I don’t; but they’ve got up one for
their own. Do you hear that?” answered
Ralph, as the warning roll of a drum, followed
by the music of a band, rang out on the air.
“The procession, or whatever it is, is coming
this way, too. Now I shall expect to see something
that will eclipse any thing New London
ever thought of getting up.”</p>

<p class='c019'>It wasn’t a celebration; it was only the annual
review of the Mount Airy fire department,
which was always held on the Fourth of July.
Ralph and his cousins were fully prepared to
make all sorts of fun of it, but when the head
of the procession came into view around the
corner of the street below, they were so surprised
at the size of it that they had not a word
to say. It took up the whole width of the
street, and that it was determined to have all
the room it wanted, was made plain by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>actions of a couple of mounted policemen who
rode in front to clear the way.</p>

<p class='c019'>“That’s good marching, boys,” said Loren,
who had seen so much of it in New London that
he thought himself qualified to judge. “It is
a very creditable display for so small a place as
this.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Every body seems to think it’s going to be
something grand,” sneered Tom, who was really
amazed at the rapidity with which the spacious
veranda was filled by the guests, who came
pouring out of the wide doors in a steady
stream.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why, there’s a military company in line
with the firemen—two of them,” exclaimed
Ralph.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Visiting companies, no doubt,” said Tom,
“and that’s what makes every one so anxious
to see them.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“There’s where you are wrong, Tom,” said
Mr. Farnsworth, who, approaching them unobserved,
had heard every word of their conversation.
“You never saw a parade just like
this, and I don’t believe you will ever see another
unless your father and I carry out some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>plans we have been talking about, and come up
here to live.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“To live?” echoed Tom.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Up here in the woods?” cried Ralph.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Among all these country greenhorns!”
chimed in Loren.</p>

<p class='c019'>“You will find very few country greenhorns
in Mount Airy,” said Mr. Farnsworth, with a
laugh. “Why, boys, those fire companies represent
millions of New London’s business capital.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh!” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Ah!” said Ralph.</p>

<p class='c019'>“That makes the thing look different,” added
Loren. “I supposed that they were made
up of the same material we used to find in the
old volunteer organizations.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“By no means. They are all rich and intelligent
men. They own valuable property here,
and by taking an interest in their fire department,
they get their insurance at much lower
rates than we do in the city.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The near approach of the column put a stop
to the conversation. First came the drum-major,
a big six-footer, with a high bear-skin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>cap, which made him look a great deal taller
than he really was, and behind him the band,
which discoursed as fine music as any body
wanted to hear. Then came the hook and
ladder company, two hundred strong, marching
four abreast and drawing their heavy truck
after them without the least apparent exertion.
Next came a steam fire engine, drawn by men
instead of horses, after that a hose cart, followed
by a small company of about twenty
young fellows in black dress-coats and white
trowsers and caps, who pulled along something
that looked like a skeleton road wagon,
loaded with Babcock fire extinguishers.</p>

<p class='c019'>“That’s a little the queerest looking turn-out
I ever saw,” Tom remarked. “<i>They</i> couldn’t
do any thing toward putting out a fire. I suppose
they are more for show than any thing
else.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Wrong again,” said Mr. Farnsworth.
“They have done good work, and the citizens,
in recognition of their services, presented them
with money enough to build an engine house
for themselves, and furnish it in fine style.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Next came the soldiers, veterans, every one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>of them, and behind them a company of oddly
uniformed youngsters, whose movements were
governed by the blast of a bugle instead of the
word of command. They must have been the
ones the guests were waiting for, for when they
came in sight, and, following the movements of
the military company, executed the maneuver:
“Platoons right front into line,” which they
did with as much soldier-like precision as the
veterans themselves, the gentlemen on the
veranda cheered them lustily, while the ladies
waved their handkerchiefs and bombarded the
ranks with bouquets, which were deftly caught
by the boys, and impaled upon the ends of
their long bows.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Now, then, can any body tell me who and
what those fellows are?” exclaimed Ralph.</p>

<p class='c019'>“They are the Mount Airy Toxophilites,”
replied Mr. Farnsworth.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Lovers of a bow or arrow,” said Ralph, who
was well up in his Greek. “What do they
do?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh, they have regular shooting-matches,
drills and parades, and now and then a hunt
and a camp in the woods.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>“They can’t hit any thing with those bows,
of course.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Yes, I believe they can,” replied Mr.
Farnsworth. “I am told that when they go on
a hunt, they are as sure of coming back full-handed
as those who use guns. After passing
in review before the trustees, they are to have a
drill in the park. I see that a good many of
the guests are getting ready to go down, and if
you would like to see it, we will go also.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom and his cousins had found reason to
change some of their opinions during the last
few minutes, and that was just what Mr.
Farnsworth desired. He had talked with that
very end in view—to make them see that New
London was not the only place in the world in
which boys could enjoy themselves, and to prepare
them for the change which he and his
brother-in-law, Tom’s father, intended to make
that very summer. They were anxious to get
their boys away from New London, for it was
full of temptations which Tom and his cousins
found it hard to resist. They were learning to
think more of billiards than they did of their
books, and they had even been known to roll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>ten-pins for soda water. Soda water wasn’t
hurtful, and neither were ten-pins nor billiards;
but the conditions under which the one was
imbibed and the others played certainly were.
In Mount Airy there was none of that sort of
thing. Of course there were billiard rooms and
ten-pin alleys there, but they belonged to the
hotels, and were kept for the exclusive use of
the guests. The men who had just marched up
the street owned all the land for miles around,
and they would not sell a foot of it. They
were willing to lease it for a term of years, but
before they did so, they wanted to know all
about the man who applied for the lease, and
the business he intended to follow while he
remained in town. In that way they made the
society of the village just what they wanted it
to be. It is true that some objectionable characters
now and then secured a temporary foothold
there, but as soon as they were detected,
they were “bounced” without ceremony.</p>

<p class='c019'>Mr. Farnsworth and Mr. Bigden thought
Mount Airy would be just the place for their
boys, but the latter would have raised the most
decided objections if the subject of a change of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>residence had been broached to them before
they witnessed that parade, and learned something
about the men and boys who composed
it.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I’ll tell you what’s a fact!” said Tom, as
he and his cousins walked with Mr. Farnsworth
toward the park where the drill was to be held.
“Uncle Alfred was right when he said that we
would not find many country bumpkins here.
Those bowmen must have lots of fun. Do you
and father really intend to come here to live?”
he added, turning to Mr. Farnsworth.</p>

<p class='c019'>“We have been thinking and talking about
it for a long time,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c019'>“All right. I am in favor of it,” said Tom.
“I wonder if we could get into that company
of archers!”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Of course we could,” said Loren.</p>

<p class='c019'>“There’s no ‘of course’ about it,” answered
his father. “You would be balloted for the
same as the rest; and I have been told that one
black-ball would keep you out for a year.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Humph!” exclaimed Tom. “They
wouldn’t black-ball <i>us</i>. I guess our folks have
just as much money as any body here.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“No, they haven’t; and even if they had, it
would make no sort of difference. Money
doesn’t rule the world up here as it does down
in New London. I am informed that some of
the boys in that company are so poor that the
others had to help them buy their uniforms.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Humph!” said Tom. “Well, if that’s the
sort of trash they take into their company, I
don’t know that I care to belong to it, do you,
boys? We don’t have any thing to do with
such fellows in the city.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Couldn’t we gradually weed them out?”
asked Loren. “That’s the way we did with
our ball club, you know.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Yes, and what was the consequence?”
demanded his father. “You ‘weeded out’
your very best players, and you have been
beaten by every club you have met since.
Served you right, too.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, I would rather be beaten than be
chums with fellows who were too mean to chip
in two or three dollars when we wanted to get
up a dinner,” observed Loren.</p>

<p class='c019'>“They were not too mean; they couldn’t do
it. The two or three dollars that you speak of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>so lightly, were a large sum in the eyes of boys
whose fathers gain a livelihood by working by
the day, and you ought to have exercised a
little common sense in your dealings with them.
If it were necessary that you should have the
dinner or starve, why did you not pay for it
yourselves, and not ask those poor boys to
‘chip in’, as you term it? There’s the high
school,” said Mr. Farnsworth, pointing with
his cane to an imposing building, standing in
the midst of extensive and well-kept grounds
which occupied one whole block of the village
property.</p>

<p class='c019'>“That’s my great objection to Mount Airy,”
said Ralph, shaking his fist at the school house.
“Our teacher told us one day last term that
the binomial theorem is just the same in China
and Brazil that it is in New London, so I suppose
it must be the same up here. Fine scenery
around a school house doesn’t make the lessons
inside any easier.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“You’re right there,” growled Tom, who
was thinking of those Orations of Cicero to
which he would have to devote his attention
next term, “I’d much rather go fishing.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>The boys reached the park long before the
procession did, and took up a position near the
pagoda in which the president of the village
and the trustees were to stand while the line
passed in review. When it arrived, the band
led the way around the park until it met the
advancing column; then it turned inside of it
and went around again, and thus the whole
line, with the exception of the Toxophilites,
was wound up like a coil. The archers kept
straight ahead, the boys in the ranks carrying
arms, and the captain saluting by bringing his
bow to a position that somewhat resembled the
“secure arms” of the tactics, until they
reached a clear space at the other end of the
park which had been reserved on purpose for
them. There they halted, and, when the firemen
had broken ranks, and the soldiers had been
brought to parade rest, their commanding officer
put them through the manual of arms and
some intricate evolutions in the school of the
company, giving his orders to the bugler who
stood beside him, and not to the company
itself. Ralph and Loren were delighted with
every thing they saw, and had many words of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>praise to bestow upon the young bowmen; but
Tom was silent and sullen. He didn’t like to
hear so much cheering when none of it was
intended for him. When he was engaged in a
game of ball he always flew into a passion if he
made an error, or if any of the other side made
a play that called forth applause from the spectators.
He was angry now; but it would have
puzzled a sensible boy to tell what reason he
had for it.</p>

<p class='c019'>“That captain, or whatever you call him—”
began Loren.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Master bowman,” said his father.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, he is a nobby fellow, and that bugler
looks gorgeous in his green uniform with its
white facings,” continued Loren. “I wonder
who they are, any way?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why don’t you go and inquire?” asked
Mr. Farnsworth.</p>

<p class='c019'>“They wouldn’t speak to you,” snarled
Tom. “They’re little upstarts; I can tell that
from here by the frills they throw on.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Loren and his brother didn’t care if they
were. The signs seemed to indicate that they
were coming to Mount Airy to live, and if that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>was the case, they wanted to know something
about the boys they would have for their
associates. So as soon as the drill was brought
to an end and the ranks were broken, they set
out to scrape an acquaintance with the
master bowman and bugler, Tom following
them with rather a listless, indifferent air.
But in reality he was as eager as his cousins
were. Would he not be willing to give something
handsome if he could make himself the
leader of a select band like that?</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c018'>LOREN and Ralph Farnsworth, in spite
of Tom’s predictions to the contrary,
had no trouble in scraping an acquaintance
with the first bowman they met. It was Arthur
Hastings, the secretary of the company and one
of the best shots in it. They drew his attention
by touching their hats to him as he passed
(that is, the brothers did, Tom being in too bad
humor to be civil), and Arthur seeing that they
desired to speak to him, stopped and opened
the conversation himself.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I know almost every stranger here this
summer, but I don’t remember to have seen you
two before,” said he, pulling off his white
gloves and extending a hand to each of them.</p>

<p class='c019'>“We came on the early morning train,”
replied Ralph. “We were just in time to witness
your parade, which I assure you was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>something we did not expect to see up here in
the woods. You bowmen are bully soldiers.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Thank you,” said Arthur, raising his hand
to his hat in response to Tom’s very slight nod.
“There must be something in what you say,
for every one who comes up here tells us the
same. The truth is, we ought to be proficient.
We have been under the strictest kind of a
drill-master, and have done plenty of hard
work since our organization two years ago.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“What first put the idea into your heads?”
inquired Loren. “You got it out of your
history, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“And if you did, why don’t you dress up
like Indians and adopt their system of tactics?”
chimed in Tom, who for the moment forgot
that he had resolved that he would not have a
word to say to any of the bowmen. “I have
read that the Sioux have a drill of their own
which is so very bewildering that our best
troops can’t stand against it. It seems to me
that you make hard work of something that
might, under different management, be made
to yield you any amount of pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“We are very well satisfied with the way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>our affairs are managed,” answered Arthur,
who did not quite like the tone in which Tom
uttered these words. “You must know that
we are not copying the aborigines, but the
Merry Bowmen of Robin Hood’s time. Of
course we have to work, for if we didn’t we
couldn’t give exhibition drills; but somehow
we see plenty of fun with it all. The idea was
suggested to us, not by our histories, but by
an old man who lives up here in the woods,”
added Arthur, turning to Loren, at the same
time jerking his thumb over his shoulder and
nodding his head toward an indefinite point of
the compass. If he intended by these motions
to give his auditors an idea of the direction in
which the old man referred to lived, he failed
completely. “He has seen better days. He
used to belong to an archery club in his own
country—that’s England, you know—and I tell
you he is a boss shot. He makes a very good
living with his bow now; but he is so much
ashamed of the accomplishment—”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Excuse me,” interrupted Loren. “I
don’t see why he should be ashamed of it.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Neither do I,” said Arthur. “But you see,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>there are very few people in this country who
take any interest in archery, and sportsmen,
as a general thing, look upon the long bow as a
toy; but they always change their minds when
they see what it can be made to do in the hands
of an expert. Now take those two boys, for
example,” added Arthur, directing Loren’s
attention to the master bowman and his bugler.
“It isn’t every rifle shot who can break as many
glass balls in the air as they can.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Who are they?” inquired Tom. “We
noticed them particularly during the drill.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“They are Wayring and Sheldon. Would
you like to know them? They’re good fellows.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Arthur looked at Tom as he said this, but
Tom didn’t act as though he heard him. He
wasn’t anxious to make the acquaintance of
boys who could beat him at any thing, but his
cousins were not so mean spirited.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Certainly we would,” replied Ralph. “It
looks now as though we were coming here to
live; and if we do, we should like to know
something about the boys into whose company
we shall be thrown.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>It would seem from this that Ralph took it
for granted that he and his brother and cousin
would get into the company without the least
trouble, and he was somewhat surprised because
Arthur did not offer to take in their names at
the very next meeting; but he did not even ask
them what their names were. He led them to
the place where the master bowman and his
bugler were standing in the midst of a party of
their friends, and, as soon as the opportunity
was presented, introduced them as visitors who
thought it possible that they might one day
become permanent residents of the village.
Then he excused himself and went off to hunt
up one of the girls with green and white badges,
who were carrying little buckets of lemonade
around among the thirsty firemen and soldiers.</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom and his cousins found the young archers
to be very pleasant and agreeable fellows, but
a trifle too independent to suit them. They
did not seem to think that Tom was better than
any other boy because his father was a banker,
and owned a yacht in which he talked of going
to Florida during the coming winter, and
neither did they ask him and his cousins to step
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>up to the armory when they fell into ranks and
marched up to put away their bows and
quivers. They left them standing in the park,
as they did scores of others who had been talking
to them, and that was a slight that Tom
said he would not soon forget.</p>

<p class='c019'>“You are altogether too touchy,” said Loren,
with some impatience in his tones. “You
appear to think that every boy who lives outside
the city limits must, of necessity, be a
greenhorn. These fellows know as much about
New London as we do.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“When I become a member of that company,
I shall use my best endeavors to bring about a
different state of affairs,” said Tom, decidedly.
“If they are taking pattern after Robin Hood,
why don’t they pass their time as he and his
men did, lounging about in the greenwood under
the shade of the trees, instead of parading
through the streets on a hot day like this? I
don’t see any fun in that.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Nevertheless, before he had passed a week in
Mount Airy, Tom Bigden decided that it was
just such a place as he had always thought he
should like to live in, and his cousins came to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>the same conclusion. So did their fathers and
mothers; and so it came about that a couple of
Mr. Wayring’s handsome cottages, on the other
side of the lake, were rented until such time as
Mr. Farnsworth and his brother-in-law could
erect houses on the grounds they had leased in
the village.</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom and his cousins lost no time in getting
ready to enjoy themselves. Before another
week had passed away, they had the finest sail
and row boats, and the most expensive canoes
on the lake; and in anticipation of their immediate
admittance to the ranks of the Toxophilites,
they sent for a supply of bows and
arrows and ordered uniforms of their tailor.
But the old saying, that there’s many a slip,
held good in their case; and this was the way
they found it out:</p>

<p class='c019'>One afternoon they and their parents
were invited to a lawn party, at which the
Toxophilites, girls as well as boys, appeared
in force and in uniform, the girls wearing
white dresses, green sashes and badges,
and light straw hats, turned up at the side
and fastened by a tiny silver arrow, which, at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>the same time, held in place the long black
plume of the company. Tom declared that
they looked stunning; and when he saw how
they sent their arrows into the target, hitting
the gold almost as often as they missed it, and
played croquet and skipped about the lawn
tennis ground, he added that he had never
been to such a party before, nor seen handsomer
girls. He was going to apply for admission
to the club, and he wasn’t going to waste
any time in doing it, either. With this object
in view, he hurried off to find Arthur Hastings.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I don’t wonder that you fellows are happy
here,” was the way in which he began the conversation.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Yes, I suppose we see as much pleasure as
falls to the lot of most people,” answered
Arthur, “but we have any amount of hard
work as well.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I never see you do any,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c019'>“That’s because you are not acquainted
with us or our ways. I drilled until after ten
o’clock last night, and spent this forenoon in
working in the garden and wrestling with my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>geometry; getting ready for next term you
know.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Do you study and work during vacation?”
exclaimed Tom, who had never heard of such
a piece of foolishness before.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Of course I do; we all do.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I’m glad that I haven’t such parents as you
seem to have,” said Tom, rudely.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Our parents have nothing whatever to do
with it. It’s the rule of the company.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“That you shall work during vacation?”
cried Tom.</p>

<p class='c019'>“That we shall keep busy at something—yes.
We are told that an idle brain is the workshop
of a certain old chap who shall be nameless,
but we go further, and hold that there is no
such thing as an idle brain. It is at work all
the time during our waking hours, and sometimes
when we are asleep—dreams, you know—and
if it is not busy with good things, it is
ready to take in bad ones. Have you seen any
boys loafing around the corners since you have
been here? Then you can bet your bottom
dollar that they didn’t belong to us.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, when I get to be a member of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>company, I shall vote down all such rules as
that,” said Tom to himself. “A fellow needs
a little time to be lazy, and I shall take it, too,
without asking any body’s consent.” Then
aloud he asked, as if the thought had just
occurred to him: “By the way, when do you
hold your next meeting?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Thursday night.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, take in our names, will you? Mine
and my cousins’.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I should be glad to oblige you, but I can’t
do it.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“You can’t do it?” said Tom, who was angry
in an instant. “Why not, I’d like to know?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“There are two reasons. In the first place,
you have not been here long enough—we don’t
know any thing about you.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“If that isn’t a little ahead of any thing I
ever heard of I wouldn’t say so!” exclaimed
Tom, as soon as his rage would permit him to
speak. “My father is—”</p>

<p class='c019'>“We don’t care who or what your father is;
we must know what <i>you</i> are. In the second
place, our membership is limited, and the boys’
roster is full.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>“Couldn’t you suspend the rules for
once?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“That’s no rule. It is a part of the constitution.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, couldn’t you amend it?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“No, we couldn’t. It has been tried in the
case of one of the best fellows in town—or,
rather, he was one of the best until he found
that he couldn’t wind eighty boys and girls
around his finger, and then he turned against
us and stands ready to-day to do us all the
harm he can.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“And you will find, to your cost, that my
cousins and I will do the same thing,” thought
Tom, and it was all he could do to keep from
uttering the words aloud. “Things have come
to a pretty pass when a lot of Yahoos can make
gentlemen knuckle to them. Who is this
boy?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“His name is Prime; but I tell you, as a
friend, that you must not have any thing to do
with him if you want to get into the company.
There are half a dozen of our fellows going
away this fall, and then, if you feel like it, you
can make a try for membership. Perhaps I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>shall be able to help you to the extent of one
vote, though I can’t promise to do so.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“How about the yacht and canoe clubs?”
said Tom, with something like a sneer in his
tones. “No doubt they are full, too.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh, no, they’re not. Any good fellow who
owns a boat or who intends to get one, can
come in there. Are you and your cousins
good swimmers? Then why don’t you join us
and enter for the up-set race that will come off
next month.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I don’t know what kind of a race that
is.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“It’ll not take long to tell you. You see
the contestants come out clad in some light
stuff that won’t hold much water, and when
they are well started in the race, a signal is
given, generally the blast of a bugle, whereupon
each fellow must overturn his boat, climb
into her again and go ahead as if nothing had
happened. The one who crosses the line first,
is of course the winner.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Who among you is the best at that kind
of a race?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well,” replied Arthur, with some hesitation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>“it is nip and tuck between Wayring,
Sheldon and me.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I expected as much,” said Tom, to himself.
“Wayring, Sheldon and Hastings are better
than the rest at every thing. I shall enter for
that or some other race, and if I don’t take the
conceit out of all of you, I shall never forgive
myself. Then it would not be of any use for
me to try to get into the Toxophilites?” he
said, aloud.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Not the slightest. I’ll tip you the wink
when there is an opening, and you can apply
or not, just as you think best. We never ask
any body to join us.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“But you asked me to join the canoe and
yacht clubs.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I know it, and I had a right to. The three
organizations are governed by entirely different
rules. There’s the bugle,” said Arthur, catching
up his bow which lay on the rustic bench
on which he and Tom had been sitting during
this conversation. “I must go and shoot as
soon as I can find my girl. Come on, and see
us punch the gold three times out of five.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I can’t,” replied Tom. “I must hunt up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>the hostess, tell her I have had a very pleasant
time and all that, and bid her good-by. I have
another engagement.”</p>

<p class='c019'>This was not quite in accordance with the
facts of the case. Tom had no other engagement,
but he wanted to go off by himself,
or in company with Loren and Ralph, and give
full vent to his feelings of disappointment and
rage. He shook his fist at Arthur when the
latter turned his back and hurried away, and
it would have afforded him infinite satisfaction
if he could have followed him up and knocked
him down. He found his cousins after a while,
and although they stood in the midst of a jolly
group and were laughing gaily, and appeared
to be enjoying themselves, Tom was well enough
acquainted with them to tell at a glance that
they were as angry as he was.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Sorry to break in upon so pleasant a gathering
as this one seems to be,” said Tom, approaching
the group, one of whom was the
young lady in whose honor the party was given,
“but our time is up.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why, Mr. Bigden, you don’t mean to say
that you are going away so soon, and before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>supper, too?” exclaimed the young lady, who
looked so charming in her neat uniform that
Tom had half a mind to go back and pound
Arthur Hastings for telling him that he couldn’t
become a Toxophilite at once.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Must—can’t be helped,” answered Tom,
giving his cousins a look which they understood.
“We are indebted to you for a very
pleasant afternoon, Miss Arden.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I don’t believe you have enjoyed yourselves
one bit,” exclaimed the fair archer. “If you
have, why do you go away so early? The next
time you attend one of our lawn parties, be
sure and arrange your business so that your
other engagements can wait.”</p>

<p class='c019'>After a little more badinage of this sort, Tom
and his cousins lifted their hats and walked off.
As soon as the front gate had closed behind
them, the expression on their faces changed as
if by magic, and the three boys turned toward
one another with clenched fists and flashing
eyes. After each one had glared savagely at
his neighbor as if he were going to strike him,
they all put their hands in their pockets and
moved away. Tom was the first to speak.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>“Now that I look back at it, I don’t see how
I kept my hands off that Hastings boy while
he was talking so insolently to me,” said Tom.
“He told me that he didn’t care who or what
my father was, but I couldn’t get into the
archery club, and that was all there was about
it. They must stick to their constitution, no
matter if the world goes to pieces on account of
their obstinacy. He asked me to join the canoe
and yacht clubs, but said they never asked
any body to apply for admission to the Toxophilites.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I guess Ralph and I know just what he
said to you first and last,” remarked Loren,
“for Sheldon talked to us in about the same
way. We are going to enter for the upset
race.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I thought you would,” answered Tom,
“and so I made up my mind to go in too.
We’ll make it our business to see that neither
Sheldon nor Wayring wins that or any other
race. If we find that we can’t beat them by
fair means, and I have an idea that I can
paddle a boat about as fast as the next boy,
although I never got into one until last week,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>we’ll foul them, and sink their boats so deep
that they will never come up again.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Loren and I talked that matter over, and
resolved upon the same thing,” said Ralph.
“Did Hastings tell you any thing about a
George Prime who is down on them because
they would not take his name before the
Toxophilites? Sheldon told us to give him a
wide berth, but Loren and I thought we would
do as we pleased about that.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“That’s just what I thought,” answered
Tom. “I think it would be a good plan to
hunt him up the very first thing we do. If he
has reason to dislike Wayring and his friends,
we might induce him to strike hands with us.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“That was our idea,” said Ralph. “It
can’t be possible that Prime is the only boy in
this village who does not like Wayring and the
rest, and if we find them to be the right sort,
and can raise enough of them, what’s the
reason we can’t get up a club of our own?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“That’s another idea,” said Tom, who was
delighted with it. “I wish I had thought to
ask Hastings where Prime lives.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I know where his father’s drug-store is, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>I saw the sign over the door,” said Loren.
“Let’s go down there and get a cigar, and trust
to our wits to learn something about him.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The others agreeing to this proposition,
Loren led the way to the drug-store, and the
three stopped in front of the show-case near
the door in which the cigars were kept.</p>

<p class='c019'>“That’s Prime, and I know it,” whispered
Tom, as a dashing young fellow, who was
seated at the further end of the store reading a
paper, came up to attend to their wants. “He
looks to me like a chap who isn’t in the habit
of allowing himself to be imposed upon, and
that’s the sort we want to run with.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“See-gahs? Yes, sir,” said the clerk.
“Being from the city, you want the best, of
course. There you are, sir. Genuine imported.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“How do you know that we are from the
city?” inquired Loren, as he made a selection
from the box that was placed on the show-case.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Because I was a city boy myself, until
father took it into his head that he wanted to
spend a summer at Mount Airy,” replied the
clerk. “That was a bad move for me, for we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>have been here ever since. Besides, in a little
place like this, every body knows more about
your business than you do yourself. I know
who you are, and where you came from, and
all about it.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Then it was a bad change for you, was it?”
said Ralph. “You don’t like to live here?
Neither do we.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I don’t blame you,” said the clerk.
“Wait until you get acquainted with some of
these old-timers and find out what an exclusive
lot they are, and you will dislike it worse than
you do now. There are a few of them, especially
the Toxophilites, as they call themselves,
who try to monopolize all the fun there is
going.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why don’t you join them?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Because they won’t let me—that’s why.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Then you must be George Prime.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“That’s my name, and you are Tom Bigden,
and you two are Loren and Ralph Farnsworth.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“You’ve hit it,” answered Tom. “They
wouldn’t take us in either. They told us so
not more than an hour ago. Why didn’t you
go to the party?”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>“Because they didn’t invite me,” said Prime,
angrily. “I don’t get invitations to any thing
any more. I showed rather too much spirit to
suit them, and so they dropped me.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Probably they will do the same by us,”
said Loren. “We have always been in the
habit of doing as we pleased, and we don’t
intend to change our mode of life for the sake
of getting into an archery club that makes its
members drill until ten o’clock when they
might see more fun in playing billiards. There
will be some vacancies this fall, and then we
shall make another attempt to get in.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Is that what you have made up your minds
to? Well, now, look here.” As Prime said
this, he came out from behind the counter and
stood in the open door, looking up and down
the street. “You must begin by doing your
smoking in secret,” he continued, as he came
back and motioned to the boys to follow him
toward the rear of the store.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Do you mean to say that the Toxophilites
look with disfavor upon a good cigar?”
demanded Tom.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I do, indeed. You mustn’t use tobacco in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>any form, and you must be temperate in all
things—in eating, drinking and talking.
They’ll fine you if you use any language while
you are out with your companions, that you
wouldn’t use if your mother or sister was
present. Now sit down here, and if you see
any body coming, you can put your cigars out
of sight.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“But we don’t know all the members of the
club,” said Loren.</p>

<p class='c019'>“No difference. Don’t let any one see you
with a weed in your mouth. If you do, good-by
to all your chances of being a Toxophilite.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why, it’s the meanest little town I ever
heard of!” exclaimed Ralph, who was greatly
surprised as well as disgusted. “I didn’t suppose
that there were any such boys in this
wicked world. I thought they all lived in
Utopia.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“So did I, until I found some of them right
here in Mount Airy,” answered Prime. “The
girls are at the bottom of it—you know that
they are never easy unless they are kicking up
a row of some kind—and if I had been a member
of the club when it was organized, wouldn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>I have worked hard to keep them out? I was
very anxious to get into it once, but I don’t
believe I care to be one of them now.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom and his cousins began to feel the same
way.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>
  <h2 class='c011'>CHAPTER V. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>TOM INTERVIEWS THE SQUATTER.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_5 c018'>“I DON’T believe I care to be one of them
now,” repeated Prime, who, being a
pretty good judge of character, knew that he
ran no risk in speaking freely in the presence of
the three boys before him. “I wish I could see
their old organization knocked higher than the
moon; or else I wish that a few more new fellows
of the right sort would come in, so that
we could have a club of our own.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I was about to suggest that very thing,”
said Tom. “It can’t be possible that Wayring
and his cronies have got every boy in town under
their thumbs.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Not by a long shot!” exclaimed Prime.
“There are ten or a dozen besides myself who
do not bow to them.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“And my cousins and I add three to the
number,” replied Tom. “That’s enough for a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>hunting club. But we will talk about that
at some future time. Do you belong to the
other clubs?”</p>

<p class='c019'>Prime replied that he did, adding that any
body could get into them, for there was no limit
to the membership.</p>

<p class='c019'>“The canoe and yacht clubs are getting large
enough to be unwieldy,” said he. “I know of
a good many boys who are not satisfied with
the way things are managed, and it wouldn’t
surprise me at all if there should be a split some
day. There are a few of us who are talking it
up as fast as we can. We are getting tired of
seeing the same old tickets elected every year,
and think it high time we had a change.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Is Wayring much of a canoeist?” asked
Tom.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Indeed, he is. He can walk away from any
one around here, I am sorry to say, and in fact,
there’s hardly any thing that boy can’t do. I
would give almost any thing to see him beaten,
and I—say!” exclaimed Prime, a bright idea
striking him. “Are you fellows canoeists?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“My cousins are; but I can’t say as much
for myself,” answered Tom. “I have always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>been called a very fair sculler, and after I learn
how to balance a canoe, I know I have muscle
enough to make her get through the water.
Hastings led me to believe that it was a tight
squeak between Wayring, Sheldon and himself.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Aw!” said Prime, in a tone of disgust.
“You let Hastings alone for shoving in a good
word for himself as often as the opportunity
offers. He never won the first prize in his life.
Joe Wayring walks away with it every time.
Suppose you fellows come in and see if you
can’t make Joe lower his broad pennant for a
while. If you find that you can’t beat him—and,
although I am no friend of his, I tell you
plainly that it will be the hardest piece of work
you ever undertook—you might get in his way
and let him foul you, you know. I tried my
level best to do it last year, but he was too
smart for me.”</p>

<p class='c019'>By this time it was plain to all the boys that
they understood one another perfectly. The
truth of the matter was, that Joe Wayring and
some of his particular friends had won too
many honors, and made themselves altogether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>too popular in the community. These boys
were angry about it, because they wanted to be
first in every thing themselves. Tom Bigden
and his cousins had fully intended to take
Mount Airy by storm, and to establish themselves
at once as leaders among their new
acquaintances; and their failure to accomplish
their object bewildered as well as enraged them.
If they had known how to go about it, they
would have disgraced Joe Wayring before he
saw the sun rise again. So would George
Prime. Of course they did not say it in so
many words, but that was what each boy told
himself.</p>

<p class='c019'>Before Tom and his cousins left the store they
entered into an alliance with Prime, both offensive
and defensive, and talked over various plans
for annoying the boys who had unwittingly
incurred their displeasure. If they could not
injure Joe and his friends in any other way,
they could put them to some trouble and
expense, and this they resolved to do the very
first good chance they got. They did not decide
upon any particular course of action, but Prime
said that if Tom and his cousins would come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>to the store the next day, he would introduce
them to a lot of good fellows who did not like
Joe and his “clique” any too well, and who
would be glad to be revenged upon them for
some real or imaginary grievance.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I see very clearly that there is a good deal of
feeling against Wayring and his followers, and
if we handle it rightly we can make it work to
our advantage,” remarked Tom, as he and his
cousins walked slowly homeward. “It is a
wonder to me that something hasn’t been done
to him before this time. What they lack is a
leader—some one to propose a plan and go
ahead with it.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, they have found him at last—three
of him,” said Loren. “I always was opposed
to living in a little country town, because you
invariably find fellows there who think they
know more than any body else—”</p>

<p class='c019'>“And plenty of others who are willing to
uphold them in that belief,” chimed in Ralph.
“I say, don’t let’s have any thing to do with the
Toxophilites. Let’s get up a club of our own
and manage it as we see proper.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I am in favor of that,” replied Tom.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>“We’ll have no fines and drills, for one thing,
and neither will we admit any girls who stick
up their noses at a good cigar. But there is
one thing we must not forget to do when we
meet those fellows at the store to-morrow. If
we decide upon any thing, we must be careful
how we carry it out. If we are foolish enough
to let Joe and the rest know that we are down
on them, and that we intend to do them all the
injury we can, they will make things very
unpleasant for us. We don’t want them to
serve us as they have served Prime, and read
us entirely out of their good books—”</p>

<p class='c019'>“And that is just what they will do if they
see us in Prime’s company,” interrupted Loren.
“Sheldon said so.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“There is no need that they should ever see
us in his company,” replied Tom. “Our best
plan would be to hold all our meetings in
secret—”</p>

<p class='c019'>“And keep our organization, if we have any,
a secret,” chimed in Ralph.</p>

<p class='c019'>“That’s the idea,” said Tom. “Then we
can do as much damage as we please in the
way of setting boats adrift, and so on, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>Joe and his followers will be at loss to know
where the annoyance comes from. We mustn’t
forget to speak to the fellows about that to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Unfortunately an incident happened that
very afternoon which made it comparatively
easy for the three schemers to carry out the
plans they proposed. It was, in fact, a fight
between a squatter and the Mount Airy
authorities, to whom he had made himself
obnoxious. Tom and his cousins were
witnesses of the preliminary skirmish, that is,
the serving of the notice of ejectment, and
when they heard a full report of the matter
from one of the boys to whom Prime introduced
them, their delight was almost unbounded.
Tom danced a horn-pipe in the excess of his
joy, and repeatedly declared that nothing
could have happened that was so well calculated
to further their designs. It came about
in this way:</p>

<p class='c019'>Mr. Wayring’s summer cottages were all
located on the opposite shore of the lake. The
road that led to them ran down the hill,
around the foot of the lake, and through a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>little settlement which bore the euphonious
name of “Stumptown.” Why this name had
been given to it no one seemed to know. It
certainly was not appropriate, for there was
not a stump to be seen in any of its well-cultivated
gardens, from which the Mount Airy
and Lambert Houses drew their supplies of
vegetables and small fruits.</p>

<p class='c019'>The male members of this little community
were licensed guides and boatmen—the only
ones, in fact, who had the right to serve the guests
of the hotels in that capacity. They lived on
Mr. Wayring’s land, and in neat little cottages
which the liberal owner had erected for their
especial benefit. When the season was over
and the guests returned to their homes in the
city, these men hunted and trapped in the
mountains, and entertained the village boys,
with whom they were great favorites, and who
often invaded their humble abodes during the
long winter evenings, with thrilling and amusing
tales of life in the wilderness. They taught
the boys woodcraft, and made themselves so
useful in other ways, that the young Nimrods
of the village had never been able to decide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>how they could manage to get on without
them.</p>

<p class='c019'>Into this settlement there came one day an
unkempt man, with a red nose and a very
forbidding face, who brought with him a large
punt, into which he had crowded all his
worldly treasures, including his wife and two
stalwart sons, not one of whom was one whit
more prepossessing than the husband and
father. Without saying a word to any body
the red-nosed man, who answered to the name of
Matt Coyle, took possession of a piece of ground
that had been cleared but not fenced in, and
began the erection of a shanty with boards
which formed a part of the punt’s cargo.
While he and his sons were at work Mr. Hastings,
who was one of the village trustees, rode
by. He did not at all like the appearance of the
new-comers, but he had nothing to say to them.
There was room for more guides and boatmen,
and Matt and his family might turn out
better than they looked. If they proved to be
honest, industrious people who were willing to
work for a living, Mr. Hastings was perfectly
willing that they should stay, and he knew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>that Mr. Wayring would provide a house and
garden for them. If they proved to be objectionable
in any way, it would be an easy
matter to get rid of them.</p>

<p class='c019'>Shortly after Mr. Hastings passed out of
sight Matt Coyle wanted a drink; and he
found it—not in the lake, or in the ice-cold
spring from which the guides obtained their
supply of water, but in a jug which he fished
out from a lot of miscellaneous rubbish in the
punt. After he had quenched his thirst he
passed the jug over to his wife and boys, the
whole proceeding being witnessed by Nat
Clark, the oldest man and best guide and boatman
in the settlement, who was getting his
skiff ready to take out a fishing party from
one of the hotels.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Look a yer, friend,” said Nat. “What you
got into that there jug o’ your’n?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“The best kind o’ whisky,” answered Matt
Coyle, cheerfully. “An’ I’ve got as much as
half a bar’l more in the punt. Want a drop?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Not much,” replied Nat, emphatically.
“An’ if you’re goin’ to stay about yer, you’d
best knock in the head of that there bar’l an’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>smash that there jug without wastin’ no
time.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“What fur?” demanded the red-nosed man,
who was very much surprised.</p>

<p class='c019'>“’Cause why, it’s agin the law fur stuff of
that kind to be brung into these yer grounds.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Who made that there law?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“The trustees. You’d best do as I tell you,
’cause if they find out that you’ve got it, they’ll
spill the last drop of it fur you.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“They will, eh?” exclaimed Matt. “I’d
like to see ’em try it on. They’d better not
try to boss me, ’cause me an’ my boys have
got rifles into the punt, an’ we know how to
use ’em too. Them there trustees ain’t got
no more right to say what I shall drink than
they have to say what I shall eat. Besides,
how are they goin’ to find out that I have got
it?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“<i>I</i> shan’t tell ’em, ’cause I’ve got enough to
do without botherin’ my head with other
folks’s business,” answered the guide, who
knew by the tone in which they were uttered
that there was a threat hidden under Matt
Coyle’s last words. “But you can’t keep it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>hid from ’em, an’ they’re bound to find it
out.”</p>

<p class='c019'>And sure enough they did.</p>

<p class='c019'>Having built his shanty and moved his
household goods into it, Matt Coyle and his
boys presented themselves before the manager
of the Lambert House and demanded employment
as guides and boatmen. That functionary,
who did not know that there were any
such disreputable looking people in town,
gazed at them in surprise, and told them
rather bluntly that he had nothing for them
to do. The manager of the Mount Airy House
told them the same thing. The hotel guides
were neat in person and respectful in demeanor,
and Matt and his boys were just the reverse.
The managers would not insult their guests by
giving them boats manned by such persons as
they were. Matt and his boys were angry, of
course, and after wasting the best portion of
the day grumbling over their hard luck, they
put the jug into the punt and started out on a
fishing excursion. They came back with a good
string, but the hotels and boarding-houses
refused to purchase, because their guests, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>the assistance of the guides, kept the tables
well supplied.</p>

<p class='c019'>Things went on in this way for a month,
during which Matt and his boys had twice been
thrust into the calaboose for attempting to
“run the town” to suit themselves, and at the
end of that time the trustees decided that he and
his family were of no use in Mount Airy, and
that they had better go somewhere else. On the
day the lawn tennis party was held, a notice
to Matt Coyle to pull down his shanty and
vacate the ground of which he had taken
unauthorized possession, was given to a constable,
and Tom Bigden and his cousins happened
along just as the officer had begun to read it
to him. The boys knew that there was something
going on in the settlement before they
came within sight of it, for when the officer
took the notice from his pocket the squatter
declared that he would not have any papers
served on him: and then followed a loud and
angry altercation in which Matt Coyle and his
family, the constable and half a dozen guides
took part. Tom and his companions quickened
their pace to a run, and arrived upon the scene
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>just in time to hear the squatter say, in
savage tones:</p>

<p class='c019'>“I know what’s into that there paper, an’ I
tell you agin that I won’t listen to it. Some
of them rich fellers up there on the hill want
me to go away from here, but I tell you I won’t
do it. I’ve got just as much right—”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Keep still, can’t you?” shouted the officer.
He had to shout in order to make himself heard,
for Matt Coyle’s voice was almost as loud as
a fog whistle. “I am going to read this
notice whether you listen or not.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“No, I won’t listen,” roared the squatter,
swinging his arms around his head. “I’ve
got just as much right on this here ’arth as
them rich folks up on the hill have. Where
shall I go if I leave here?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I am sure I don’t care where you go,”
replied the officer. “But you are not wanted
in Mount Airy and you can’t stay.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“But I tell you I will stay, too,” shouted
Matt, who was so nearly beside himself that
Tom and his companions looked for nothing
but to see him assault the officer. Probably he
would have laid violent hands upon him had it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>not been for the presence of the stalwart guides,
who stood close behind him. “I came here
’cause I heared that there was plenty that an
honest, hard-workin’ man could do.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“And so there is,” answered the constable,
“but you are neither honest nor hard-working.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“They wouldn’t have me an’ my boys fur
guides, ’cause we didn’t have no fine clothes to
wear,” continued Matt. “An’ nuther would
they buy the fish we ketched, ’cause—look a
yer. You needn’t try to read that there paper
to me, ’cause I won’t listen to it, I tell you.”</p>

<p class='c019'>But the constable, who had grown tired of
talking, paid no attention to him. He read
the notice, raising his voice as often as the
squatter raised his; then Matt’s boys, and
finally his wife came to his assistance, and
this started the guides, who flourished their
fists in the air and shouted until they were red
in the face. Among them all they raised a
fearful hubbub, and, of course, the officer’s
voice was entirely inaudible; but he read
calmly on, and when he had finished the document
he walked away, followed by the guides,
and leaving the squatter and his family in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>towering rage. Ralph and Loren were afraid
of them now that the constable and his broad-shouldered
backers were gone, but Tom looked
serenely on, and could hardly resist the impulse
to laugh outright when he saw Matt and his
family stamping about, shaking their clenched
hands in the air, and acting altogether as
though they had taken leave of their senses.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Let’s get away from here,” whispered
Loren, when Matt made a sudden and furious
rush toward the shanty, and began trying to
kick the side of it in with his heavy boots, just
to show how mad he was, and to give his wife
and boys some idea of the damage he would do
if he only possessed the power.</p>

<p class='c019'>“What’s your hurry?” asked Tom, indifferently.
“Can’t you see how we can turn this
to our advantage?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I can see that those people are in a terrible
rage,” replied Loren, who was really alarmed,
“and I am afraid they will turn on us
next.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“There’s no danger of that,” answered Tom,
confidently. “When men rant and rave in
that way they are not to be feared for any thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>they may do openly. They are the ones who
work in secret.”</p>

<p class='c019'>At this moment Matt Coyle became aware
that he and his family were not alone—that
there were three interested spectators close at
hand; and as if to show Tom that he was mistaken
in the opinions to which he had just
given expression, Matt rushed toward him as
if he meant to annihilate him, followed by all
the members of his family, who shook their fists
and shouted as if they were very angry indeed.
Ralph and Loren shrank back, but Tom, who
was nobody’s coward, stood his ground, looked
squarely into Matt’s eyes, and coolly put his
hands into his pockets.</p>

<p class='c019'>“What you standin’ here gapin’ at?”
demanded the squatter, fiercely. He had drawn
back his fist with the full intention of striking
Tom; but when he saw that the boy did not
appear to be at all afraid of him, he thought
better of it.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why do you come at us in that savage
way?” demanded Tom. “We don’t scare
worth a cent. If you want to get even with
any one for the shameful manner in which you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>have been treated, there’s the man you must
go for,” he added, pointing toward the grove
which concealed Mr. Wayring’s house from
view. “He is entirely to blame for all the
trouble you have had. Your cabin is on his
land, and the trustees never would have thought
of ordering you off if he had not complained of
you.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Matt and his family were greatly astonished.
They thought that every one in town looked
down on them because they were poor, but
here was somebody who sympathized with
them. Tom, quick to see that he had made an
impression upon the angry squatter, went on
to say—</p>

<p class='c019'>“If the people of this village should treat me
as they have treated you, it would make a
regular Ishmaelite of me.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“What sort of a feller is that?” asked Matt.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why, Ishmael was a hunter who lived a
good many years ago,” answered Tom. “His
hand was against every man, and every man’s
hand was against him. He didn’t have a
friend in the world.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“That’s me,” exclaimed Matt, who seemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>pleased to know that there was, or had been,
at least one other man in existence who knew
what trouble was. “I ain’t got no friends
nuther. These rich folks have tried to starve
me since I came here, but they didn’t do it—not
by a long shot.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Now, if I were situated as you are,” continued
Tom, “I would draw a bee-line for
Sherwin’s pond—”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Where’s that?” inquired Matt.</p>

<p class='c019'>“It lies off that way, fifteen miles from the
head of this lake,” replied Tom, indicating the
direction with his finger, and wondering at the
same time how Matt could have expected to
render acceptable service as guide to the guests
of the hotels, when he was not acquainted with
the surrounding country. “There are about
twelve miles of rapids in the stream that connects
the lake with Sherwin’s pond, but your
punt will go through easy enough if you can
keep her clear of the rocks. As I was saying,
I would go down there, put up my cabin and
live in peace. I’d make more money, too,
than I could by acting as guide and boatman.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>“How would you do it?” asked the squatter,
whose anger was all gone now.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Simply by keeping my eyes open. You
see those sail-boats anchored out there? Well,
if one of them should happen to get adrift some
stormy night, and come safely through the
rapids into the pond and I should catch it, I
wouldn’t give it up until I got a big reward for
saving it, would I? Then again, the pointers,
setters and hounds that hunt in these fields and
woods very often get lost, and their owners are
willing to give almost any price to get them
back. I tell you,” exclaimed Tom, who knew
by the gleam of intelligence that appeared on
the swarthy faces before him that Matt and his
family understood him perfectly, “I could
make plenty of money by taking up my abode
down there on the shore of that pond. If the
things I have been talking about didn’t happen
of themselves, I’d <i>make</i> them happen—do
you see? Well, good-by, and remember that
we three boys had no hand in driving you out
of Mount Airy.”</p>

<p class='c019'>So saying Tom walked off followed by his
companions, while Matt and his family faced
about and went toward their shanty.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>
  <h2 class='c011'>CHAPTER VI. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>TOM’S PLANS ARE UPSET.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c018'>FOR a while the three boys walked along in
silence, Loren and Ralph being too amazed
to speak, and Tom pluming himself on having
done something that would, in the end, bring
Joe Wayring and some of the other boys he disliked
no end of trouble. The fact that it might
bring trouble to himself as well, never once
entered his mind. Ralph was the first to
speak.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I wouldn’t have had that thing happen for
any thing,” said he.</p>

<p class='c019'>“What thing?” demanded Tom.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why, that interview with the squatter. I
could see, by the expression on his face, that
you put the very mischief into his head.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“And that was just what I meant to do,”
replied Tom, who laughed heartily when he
saw how troubled his cousins were over what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>he had said to Matt Coyle. “I saw he was
thick-headed and needed help, and so I gave it
to him.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“But don’t you know that it is dangerous to
trust a man like that? If he gets into trouble
through the suggestions you made to him—and
he will just as surely as he attempts to act upon
them—he’ll blow the whole thing.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“What in the world has he got to blow, and
how have I trusted him?” asked Tom, rather
sharply. “I didn’t tell him to turn the sail-boats
adrift or to steal the guests’ hunting-dogs,
did I? I simply told him what I should do if
I were in his place.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“But you intended it for a suggestion, and
hoped he would act upon it, didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, <i>that’s</i> a different matter,” answered
Tom. “If he tries to revenge himself upon the
citizens of Mount Airy for refusing to employ
him or to buy his fish, and his efforts in that
direction bring him into trouble, it will be his
own fault. You and I want to see some of
these conceited fellows, who think they know
more and are better than any body else, brought
down a peg or two, and if that squatter is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>accommodating enough to do the work for us—why,
I say let him do it.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom continued to talk in this way for a long
time, and to such good purpose that when they
reached home his cousins had forgotten their
fears, and even expressed much interest and
curiosity regarding the course of action that
Matt Coyle might see fit to pursue. If he followed
Tom’s suggestion and built his shanty
on the shore of Sherwin’s pond, they might
expect to hear from him before many days
more had passed away.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I hope that if Matt does take it into his
head to do any thing, he’ll run off Wayring’s
sail-boat,” said Loren, gazing proudly at his
own beautiful little sloop, which rode at her
moorings in front of the boat-house. He had
brought her up there on purpose to beat the
<i>Young Republic</i>, which was said to be one of
the swiftest boats on the lake; but the first time
they came together under sail, the <i>Republic</i>
had run away from her would-be rival with all
ease, and it began to look as though the
“Challenge Cup” would become Joe’s own
property. He had won it twice, and if he won
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>it again it would be his to keep. There were
those in the village who didn’t want to see him
get it. They had expected great things of the
<i>Uncle Sam</i>—that was the name of Loren’s
boat—and indeed she did look like a “flyer”;
but when they witnessed the short race, which
Joe Wayring purposely brought about one
afternoon to test the <i>Uncle Sam’s</i> speed,
they were much disappointed, and told one
another that the cup was Joe’s for a certainty.</p>

<p class='c019'>“If Matt will only take that boat, I’ll win
the next regatta,” continued Loren. “If he
does take her, Joe will never see her again, for
she will be smashed to pieces in the rapids.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“If I could have my way, I should prefer to
have Matt run off Joe’s Rob Roy, for then
you and Ralph would stand a chance of winning
some of the canoe races,” observed Tom.
“But, of course, he couldn’t steal the canoe
without breaking into the boat-house, and that
would send him up for burglary.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh, no; he won’t do that,” exclaimed Loren.</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom made no audible reply, but to himself
he said:</p>

<p class='c019'>“I don’t suppose he will; but <i>I</i> might do it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>and let Joe and the rest blame Matt Coyle for
it.”</p>

<p class='c019'>There were still several hours of daylight left,
and for want of some better way of passing the
time, as well as to put themselves in trim for
the coming canoe meet, Tom and his cousins decided
that they would spend the rest of the afternoon
on the water. Ever since their canoes
came into their possession they had been assiduously
practicing with their double paddles,
and Tom, who was quick to learn any thing
that required strength and skill for its execution,
was fast becoming an expert canoeist. In
a hurry-scurry or portage race he could beat
either of his cousins, and on this particular
afternoon he wanted to try an upset race, of
which he had that day heard for the first
time.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I saw an upset race rowed, or rather paddled,
during the meet of the American Canoe
Association at Lake George last summer, and I
wonder that I didn’t think to speak of it,” said
Ralph. “Well, better late than never. We
will go up to the head of the lake, where no
one will be likely to see us, and make our first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>trial. We are all good swimmers, and it seems
to me that we ought to make good time. The
secret lies in getting back into our canoes after
we have upset them. If we can learn to do
that easily and quickly, we will stand a chance
of putting Joe Wayring to his mettle, even if
we don’t beat him in the race.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The boys went into the boat-house by a side
door, and about ten minutes afterward the front
door swung open, and two Shadow canoes
and one Rob Roy were pushed into the water,
and as many young fellows, dressed in light
gymnastic suits, sprang into them and paddled
up the lake. They met a few sailing parties,
who waved their handkerchiefs and hats to
them as they shot by, and at the end of half an
hour reached a wide and deep cove near the
head of the lake. This was their practice
ground. They had chosen it for that purpose
because it was a retired spot, and so effectually
concealed by the long, wooded point at the
entrance, that a fleet of boats might have sailed
by without knowing that there was any one in
the cove.</p>

<p class='c019'>“We’ll start from this side and go across and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>back, as we have done heretofore,” said Ralph,
who led the way in his Rob Roy. “We’ll
upset twice—once while we are going, and once
while we are coming.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“But how does a fellow get into his canoe
after he gets out of it?” inquired Tom.</p>

<p class='c019'>“The rule is to climb in over the stern and
work your way to your seat,” replied Ralph.
“But at Lake George I saw some of the contestants
throw themselves across the cock-pit
and get in that way. We’ll try both plans,
and each fellow can adopt the one that suits
him best.”</p>

<p class='c019'>When the boys had taken up their positions
at safe distances from one another, Ralph gave
a shrill whistle and away they started, the
light Rob Roy taking the lead with Tom close
behind. A few minutes’ work with the double
paddles brought them to the middle of the cove,
and then Ralph uttered another whistle. An
instant later the three canoeists were in the
water. The Rob Roy turned completely over
and came right side up in a twinkling; and at
the same moment Ralph’s head bobbed up close
alongside. He threw himself across the cock-pit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>and climbed in with the greatest ease; and
while bailing out the water with a tin basin
that was tied to one of the timbers of the canoe
so that it could not float away or fill and sink,
he looked complacently at his companions, who
were making desperate efforts to regain their
seats by climbing over the sterns of their
respective crafts.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Grab hold of the side of your canoe, draw
yourself as far as you can out of the water,
turn a hand-spring and land on your feet in the
cock-pit,” shouted Ralph, addressing himself
to no one in particular. “I saw that done at
Lake George last summer by two or three different
men.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Suppose you do it yourself and show us
how,” answered Tom, who having at last succeeded
in gaining the deck, was slowly working
his way toward his seat; but instead of
sitting astride of his canoe, as he ought to have
done, he tried to make headway on his hands
and knees in order to beat Loren, who was
making all haste to reach the cock-pit of his
own craft. In his eagerness Tom forgot how
cranky his canoe was, and, neglecting to trim
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>her properly, she turned over and let him down
into the water again.</p>

<p class='c019'>Ralph, of course, could have won the race
very easily, but he lingered to watch the others,
so that they all reached the turning point at
the same moment. On the home stretch
another upset occurred, and this time Tom and
Loren did not waste as many minutes in getting
back as they did before. They learned rapidly,
and when half a dozen more races had been
tried they became so expert that Ralph had
little the advantage of them. By this time
they began to think they had had enough of
the water for one afternoon, so they pulled
away for the boat house, Tom easily distancing
his cousins, who tried in vain to keep up with
him.</p>

<p class='c019'>“This afternoon’s work has opened my eyes
to a thing or two,” said Ralph, after they
had changed their clothes and sponged out
their canoes.</p>

<p class='c019'>“So it has mine,” exclaimed Tom. “Let me
talk first, and see how far my conclusions agree
with yours. In the first place, you ought to win
the upset race.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>“That’s my opinion,” said Loren. “He
shall win it, too, if strategy is of any use.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“You are no sooner out of your canoe than
you are back into it again,” continued Tom.
“I am sure that neither Wayring, Hastings nor
Sheldon can do better than that. I only wish
you had a little more muscle.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“But I haven’t got it and can’t get it between
this time and the race, and so you fellows will
have to help me.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Trust us for that,” answered Tom. “Then
we’ll turn to and foul the best contestant in
the hurry-scurry race, so that Loren can win
that; and if you will lend me your Rob Roy,
I’ll take my chances on carrying off the honors
in the portage race.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“That is just the way I had planned it,”
exclaimed Ralph. “We’ll show these fellows
who think themselves so smart, that there are
others in the world who are quite as smart as
they are.”</p>

<p class='c019'>It was a very pretty programme, no doubt,
but it never occurred to Tom and his cousins
that possibly the boys to whom Prime was to
introduce them the next day, might not think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>favorably of it. There were those among them
who had never been first in any race, although
they were very expert canoeists; and it was not
at all likely that they would consent to see
these new-comers carry off the prizes for which
they had contended ever since the club was
organized.</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom and his cousins were tired enough to
rest now, and they found it lounging in their
hammocks under the trees, and watching the
boats that passed up and down the lake. They
took another short run in their canoes by
moonlight, spent the next forenoon sailing
about in Loren’s sloop, and at one o’clock bent
their steps toward the store where they were
to meet George Prime and his friends. When
they arrived at the place where Matt Coyle’s
shanty stood the day before, they were surprised
as well as delighted to find that it wasn’t
there.</p>

<p class='c019'>“He’s gone, as sure as the world,” cried
Ralph. “Now we shall very soon know
whether or not he has the pluck to do any
thing to the men who would not give him a
chance to earn an honest living.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>Tom laughed loudly.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Did you really think I was in earnest when
I told Matt yesterday that I thought he had
been shamefully treated?” said he, as soon as
he could speak. “Why, Ralph, I thought
you had more sense. I said that just to make
him mad. If I succeeded, he will do the work
that we would otherwise have been obliged to
do ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c019'>When they reached the drug-store they
found Prime waiting for them. After he had
treated them to a cigar apiece, he led them
through a rear door into a store-room, where
they discovered a dozen or more fellows perched
upon boxes and barrels, each one puffing vigorously
at a cigar or pipe. They were engaged in
a very earnest conversation which they
brought to a sudden close when the door
opened.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Here they are,” exclaimed Prime, as the
boys arose to their feet and took their pipes
and cigars out of their mouths. “Tom Bigden,
and his cousins Ralph and Loren Farnsworth,
gentlemen. I believe you have met some of my
friends before at lawn parties, ball matches and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>the like,” added Prime, addressing himself to
the new-comers.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I had the good fortune to meet them yesterday
at Miss Arden’s,” said one of the boys,
Frank Noble by name, advancing and shaking
Tom and his cousins by the hand. “And I
also had the pleasure of putting them to their
speed one day last week, when I happened to
catch them out on the lake with their canoes.
You ought to make a good one,” he added,
turning to Tom. “I could see by the way you
made that Shadow spin through the water that
you’ve got the muscle. All you want is practice.
If you keep it up, you can go in next
year with some hope of winning.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom was somewhat disconcerted by these
words, and so were Ralph and Loren, if one
might judge by the blank look on their faces.
It was clear to them that there were others besides
themselves who wanted prizes, and who
looked to their friends to assist them in winning
those prizes.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I thank you for your compliment and for
your words of encouragement,” replied Tom,
concealing his disappointment as well as he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>could, and turning to shake hands with another
boy he had met at the lawn party on the previous
day, “but I am going to win the portage
race this year.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“And if I don’t come in first in the paddle
race, it will not be because I do not try my
level best,” added Loren.</p>

<p class='c019'>“And I’m going to give somebody a pull for
the upset race,” chimed in Ralph.</p>

<p class='c019'>It was now Noble’s turn to be astonished.
He looked inquiringly at Prime, and Prime
looked at Tom and his cousins. The latter saw
very plainly that while they were laying their
plans they had interfered with arrangements
that had already been made by the boys by
whom they were surrounded, but they were none
the less determined to have their own way in
the matter. Tom, who could hardly conceal
the rage that had taken possession of him, resolved
then and there that he would stick to
his programme, no matter what promises he
might be obliged to make to the contrary. He
was like an Indian, in one respect: When he
wanted a thing he wanted it with his whole
heart, and he wanted it immediately. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>wanted a prize to show to his city friends
when they came to visit him, and he wanted
the honors that prize would bring him.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well—yes,” said Prime, who knew that
Noble and the rest expected him to say something.
“We’d like to have you win under
different circumstances, but as it is, I think—you
see—look here; I suppose you are with us
against Wayring and the other fellows who
have been walking off with the prizes every
year since the club had an existence!”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Certainly I am,” answered Tom. “We all
are, and we’re going to do the best we can to
beat them, too. Didn’t you tell us no longer
ago than yesterday that you wished we would
come into the club and make Joe Wayring
lower his broad pennant for a while?” he
added, turning to Prime.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I did; but I have had opportunity to talk
the matter over with my friends since then,
and we have decided that those who have
worked so long and so hard for the prizes,
ought to have them in preference to any new-comers.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“All right,” said Tom, silencing by a look
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>the words of indignant protest that arose to
Ralph’s lips and Loren’s. “Who comes in for
the paddle race?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I do,” said Noble.</p>

<p class='c019'>“And who is put down for the upset race?”
continued Tom.</p>

<p class='c019'>Bob Lord said that he was; and a young
fellow named Scott volunteered the information
that his friends had decided that he ought to
be allowed to win the portage race, because he
came so near winning it fairly the year before.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Then it seems that my cousins and I are to
be left out in the cold,” observed Tom, who
was mad enough to break things.</p>

<p class='c019'>“By no means,” some of the boys hastened
to explain. “There are some handsome prizes
offered for the sailing races, and we intend that
you shall win them if we can make you do it.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Don’t want ’em,” said Tom, gruffly.
“Couldn’t enter for them if we did.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Because we bought our canoes for exploring
purposes, and not for sailing. We received
such contradictory advice from those to whom
we applied for information, that it was all we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>could do to make up our minds what kind of
canoes to get; and when it came to the sails,
we thought we would let them go until we
could decide upon the style of rig we needed
without asking any one’s advice. We may
make up our minds that we don’t want any
sails at all.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh, you mustn’t do that,” exclaimed Noble,
“for if you do you will lose half the sport
of canoeing. By the way, the club meets
Saturday evening, and if you say so, I will
take in your names.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I am obliged to you,” replied Tom. “But
we had about half agreed with Wayring and
Hastings to propose us for membership.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Ralph and Loren were greatly astonished,
and Prime and his friends saw that they were.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I am sorry you did that,” said Noble.
“Every one of us here present has pledged
himself not to vote for any thing brought forward
by Wayring and his crowd.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I did it before I knew what sort of boys
they were,” said Tom, apologetically, “and I
don’t like to go back from my word. Are you
going to black-ball us for it?”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>“By no means,” exclaimed all the boys, in
a breath.</p>

<p class='c019'>“We want you to help us carry out our programme,”
added George Prime.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, all the help you will get from me
won’t amount to much, you may be sure of
that,” said Tom, to himself; and his cousins
were so well acquainted with him that they
could tell pretty nearly what he was thinking
about.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Have you spoken to Wayring about proposing
you for the yacht club?” asked Scott.</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom, with unblushing mendacity, replied
that he had.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I don’t believe the regatta will amount to
much this year,” remarked one of the boys
who had not spoken before. “If Matt Coyle
carries out the threats he made yesterday,
there won’t be any yachts to contend for the
prizes. You heard about that, I suppose?”
he added, turning to Tom and his cousins.</p>

<p class='c019'>“We were present when a legal process of
some kind was served on him yesterday, and
we heard Matt say that he wouldn’t go away,”
answered Loren. “But when we came around
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>the foot of the lake a little while ago, we found
that he had cleared out, taking his shanty
with him.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“You saw the constable serve him with a
notice to quit, did you!” exclaimed Noble.
“Well, you missed the best part of it. You
ought to have been there about three hours
later, and witnessed the fight that took place
between Matt and his family, and the officer
and his posse. The old woman proved herself
to be the best man in the lot. Matt evidently
knew that an effort would be made to eject
him by force, and his wife prepared for it by
boiling a big kettle of water. When the constable,
with a crowd of guides at his back, presented
himself at the door, she opened on him
with that hot water; and if you could have
seen the stampede that followed, you would
have laughed until your sides ached, as I
did.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“You didn’t laugh much when it happened,”
Prime remarked. “I was there, and I know
there wasn’t a man or boy in the party who
showed a neater pair of heels than one Frank
Noble.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>When the burst of merriment that followed
these words, and in which Frank joined as
heartily as any of his companions, had somewhat
subsided, the narrator continued:</p>

<p class='c019'>“I am free to confess that I didn’t see any
thing funny in the way the old woman jammed
that long-handled dipper into the kettle and
sent its boiling contents flying toward us, but
it was very amusing after it was all over, and
I woke up in the night and laughed about it.
Of course the defiant squatters were over-powered
after a while, but not until Matt and
both his boys had been knocked flat, and one of
the guides had disarmed the old woman by running
in and kicking over her kettle of water. The
officer was determined to arrest the last one of
them for resisting his authority; but Mr. Hastings,
who happened along just then, and who
thought that neighbors so undesirable could not
be got rid of any too quick, told the constable
to chuck the squatter and all his belongings
into the punt and shove them out into the lake,
after giving them fair warning that they would
be sent up as vagrants if they stopped this side
of Sherwin’s pond.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>“Did he do it?” asked Ralph.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Of course he did. But before Matt put
his oars into the water he made us a speech
containing threats which I, for one, hope he
will have the courage to carry out.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Here Noble stopped to light his cigar which
had gone out while he was talking.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>
  <h2 class='c011'>CHAPTER VII. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>A DOG WITH A HISTORY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_5 c018'>“YOU don’t want to say that out loud,
Frank,” observed Scott.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Say what out loud?” demanded Noble,
after he had taken a few long pulls at his cigar
to make sure that it was going again.</p>

<p class='c019'>“That you hope Matt Coyle will have the
courage to carry out the threats he made
yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Of course not. But I can express my
honest sentiments here, for we are all friends,
I take it. Matt’s speech was a short one,”
said Noble, once more addressing himself to
Tom Bigden and his cousins, “but it was to
the point. ‘You see all them there sail-boats
ridin’ at anchor, an’ all them fine houses up
there on the hill?’ said Matt. ‘Wal, the
boats’ll sink if there’s holes knocked into ’em,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>an’ the houses’ll burn if there’s a match set to
’em, I reckon. Good-by till you hear from
me agin.’ He hasn’t got a very handsome
face at any time, Matt hasn’t, and his intense
rage, and the black and blue lump as big as a
hen’s egg, which had been raised on one of
his cheeks by a whack from a guide’s fist,
made him look like a savage in his war-paint.
He was in dead earnest when he uttered the
words, and if the Mount Airy boys, and men
too, who have incurred his enmity don’t hear
from him again, I shall be surprised.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“And disappointed as well,” added Prime.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I didn’t say that,” replied Noble.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Of course you didn’t. Nobody said it,
but I think we understand one another.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Ralph and Loren looked frightened, while
Tom drew admiring applause from the boys and
gave expression to his feelings at the same time
by dancing a few steps of a hornpipe.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, we must be off,” said he, suddenly.
“Another engagement, you know.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“What’s your hurry,” exclaimed Prime.
“Stay and smoke another cigar.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Can’t,” replied Tom, turning a significant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>look upon Loren and Ralph, who wondered
what new idea he had got into his head.
“We’ll go and see Wayring according to promise,
and then start for home.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“But we haven’t said a word about organizing
that new archery club,” interposed Noble.
“Prime told us that you three fellows were
strongly in favor of it.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“So we are,” was Tom’s reply; “and some
day, when we have plenty of leisure, we’ll talk
it over. We are happy to have met you, and
will now say good-by until we see you again.”</p>

<p class='c019'>So saying, Tom bowed himself out of the
store-room followed by his cousins, who could
hardly hold their tongues until they reached
the street, so impatient were they to know what
he was going to do now. They were certain of
one thing, and that was, that Tom did not think
as much of George Prime and his friends as he
thought he was going to.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I am disgusted,” declared Loren, as soon as
they were safely out of hearing.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Not with me, I hope,” said his cousin.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Yes, with you and with the fellows we have
just left.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>Tom thrust his hands deep into his pockets,
looked up at the clouds and laughed heartily.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I expected it,” said he; then he stopped
laughing and scowled fiercely. His merriment
was forced, and he was as angry as he ever got
to be.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Are you willing that Prime and his crowd
should lay out a programme for the races without
saying a word to us about it?” demanded
Ralph, who forgot that that was just the way in
which he and his two companions had treated
Prime.</p>

<p class='c019'>“And did you really ask Wayring to propose
our names at the club’s next meeting?”
chimed in Loren.</p>

<p class='c019'>“No, to both your questions,” replied
Tom, emphatically. “They must be a bright
set of boys if they think we are going to let
them rule us. Why, that was the reason we
decided that we did not want any thing to do
with Wayring and his followers. But I have
thought better of that resolution, and I’m going
to make friends with Joe if I can.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“And cut Prime and the rest?” exclaimed
Ralph.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>“Not directly. Look here,” said Tom, suddenly
stopping in the middle of the sidewalk
and facing his cousins. “We’ve got our choice
between two cliques, both of which have showed
a disposition to make us do as they say. Now
which one shall we take up with? I prefer
Joe’s. He and his friends are in the majority,
and they are not one bit more overbearing than
Prime and <i>his</i> friends. Besides, they will let
us win a race if we can do it fairly, but the
crowd we have just left want all the honors
themselves.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“If you try to carry water on both shoulders
you will be sure to spill some of it,” observed
Loren.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I’ll risk that,” replied Tom, confidently.
“I didn’t ask Joe to take our names in to the
club, but I’m going to before I am ten minutes
older.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why didn’t you ask Prime or Noble to
take them in?” inquired Ralph.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Because I didn’t want Joe to know that we
had become intimate enough with those two
boys to ask favors of them. Now, then, here
we are. You know Joe invited us to call as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>often as we could, so we are sure of a welcome
if he is at home. Stand ready to back me, if
you think circumstances require it, but don’t
be surprised at any thing I say.”</p>

<p class='c019'>As Tom uttered these words he opened one
of the wide gates that gave entrance into Mr.
Wayring’s grounds, and the three walked up
the carriage way toward the house, until their
progress was stopped by the sudden appearance
of one of Joe’s pets—a Newfoundland
dog, which came out from among the evergreens
and stood in their path. He was a noble-looking
fellow, and although he was gray with
age, the attitude of defiance he assumed
seemed to say that he considered himself quite
as able to keep intruders off those premises as
he had been during his younger days.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Come on,” shouted a familiar voice.
“Mars won’t trouble you. He don’t like
tramps,” added Joe Wayring, leaning his
double paddle against the side of the house,
and coming forward to greet his visitors. “But
fellows like you could go all over the place;
and so long as you did not pick up any thing,
Mars would not say a word to you. How are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>you, any way; and where are you going on
foot? Why didn’t you come over in your
canoes, so that we could have a little race all
by ourselves? Come on. Sheldon and Hastings
are down to the boat-house waiting for
me.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“We came over to ask a favor of you,”
replied Tom, as soon as Joe gave him a chance
to speak. “Would you mind taking in our
names at the next meeting of the canoe
club?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“On the contrary, I shall be pleased to do
it,” answered Joe, readily. “You have been
pretty sly since your canoes came to hand, but
we know more about you than you think we
do,” he added, as he led the way through the
carriage-porch and down the terraced bank
toward the boat-house.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I don’t quite understand you,” said
Tom.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I mean that we have watched you while
you were taking your morning and evening
spins up and down the lake, and we have come
to the conclusion that some of us are going to
get beaten. I’ll say this much for you, Bigden:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>I never saw a Shadow canoe get through
the water, until I saw yours going down the
lake yesterday afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Thank you,” said Tom. “Do you know
who are booked for winners this year?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Booked!” repeated Joe. “There’s nobody
booked. The best men will win, as they always
have done.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I am afraid you are mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh, no; I guess not. We don’t have any
jockeying here, and if any member of the club
should so far forget himself as to interfere with
one of the contestants, he would never row
another race on this lake.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I know some boys who are going to take
their chances on it,” said Tom, quietly.</p>

<p class='c019'>“On fouling the head man so that somebody
else can win?” cried Joe.</p>

<p class='c019'>“That’s just what I mean.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Joe could hardly believe his ears, and neither
could Loren and Ralph believe theirs. This,
then, was what Tom meant when he cautioned
them against being surprised at any thing he
might say! They <i>were</i> surprised—they couldn’t
help it; and in order that Joe might not see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>their faces they fell behind, and allowed him
and Tom to go on ahead.</p>

<p class='c019'>“You know boys who are going to try to win
by foul means!” repeated Joe. “I didn’t
suppose that there was any one in the club who
would be so mean. It is true that last year a
certain canoeist persisted in keeping as close to
me as he could, and drove the bow of his craft
toward the stern of my own as often as he got
the chance; but I thought it was accident,
while some of my friends on shore declared
that it was his intention to run into me, and
claim the race because I got in his way. But,
as luck would have it, I was able to paddle fast
enough to keep out of his road. It seems to
me that if I couldn’t win a prize fairly, I
shouldn’t want to win it at all.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I know who that fellow was,” said Tom,
“and I know, also, that he tried his very best
to foul you. It was Prime. I heard all about
it.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom and his cousins supposed that Joe’s
next question would be: Who told you about
this plot, and what are the names of the boys
who are “booked” to win by fair means or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>foul? But greatly to their surprise Joe propounded
no such inquiry. The latter knew
very well that if some one had not reposed confidence
in him, Tom never would have heard of
any plot; and Joe was too much of a gentleman
to ask him to violate that confidence. He
wanted to turn the conversation into another
channel, and so he began talking about Mars,
who was walking along the path before them.</p>

<p class='c019'>“That fellow is the only foreigner in the
party,” said Joe. “He was born and received
the rudiments of his education on the bleak
shores of Newfoundland.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Then how did you come to get hold of
him?” inquired Tom.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I was up there two winters ago with my
uncle, hunting caribou.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“What sort of an animal is that?” asked
Tom. He spoke before he thought, and was
provoked at himself for it. He did not want
to be constantly asking information of a boy
who never came to him for any. As Tom would
have expressed it: “He didn’t care to make
Joe and his friends any more conceited than
they were already.” Joe, however, was not at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>all conceited; but if Tom Bigden had known
as much as he did, and been as expert in all
sorts of athletic sports, he would have thought
himself too grand to associate with common
fellows.</p>

<p class='c019'>“The caribou is the American reindeer, but
it is not broken to harness like the European
animal of the same species,” replied Joe. “It
is hunted as game, and Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick and Newfoundland are the best
places to go to find it. Uncle Joe went up
there two years ago, taking Hastings, Sheldon
and myself with him. We went in a little
fishing schooner that was bound from Gloucester
to the Bay of Fundy for swordfish.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom would have been glad to know where
the Bay of Fundy was, and what the schooner’s
crew intended to do with the swordfish after
they caught them, but his pride would not let
him ask. The sequel proved that it was not
necessary, for Joe went on to explain.</p>

<p class='c019'>“The Bay of Fundy runs up between New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia, as you of course
know as well as I do, and the fish are used for
food. When they are put on the market they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>are sliced up like halibut. They are caught with
harpoons. They are ugly, I tell you, and when
one of them weighing four hundred pounds
comes flopping over the rail and begins to swing
that sword of his around like lightning, you
may be sure that he gets all the room he
wants.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“What do you do with the swords after
they are taken off?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Keep them as curiosities or sell them, just
as you please. There is great demand for
them. I have one that I should not like to
part with. It belonged to a two hundred
pounder. The sailors thought they had killed
him before they hauled him aboard; but he gave
one expiring flop after he reached the deck,
and the point of his sword cut a big hole in
the leg of my trowsers. If I had been a little
closer to him, he might have injured me very
badly. If a man had his only weapon of
offense and defense made fast to his nose, he
wouldn’t do much with it, would he? But it
just suits the swordfish, which, according to
Captain Davis, delivers his blows so rapidly
that he will kill half a dozen out of a school
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>of albicore before they can get out of his
reach.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“But what has all this got to do with
Mars?” inquired Tom.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I came pretty near forgetting about him,
didn’t I?” said Joe, with a laugh. “Well,
we went back to Gloucester with Captain
Davis, who, as soon as he had disposed of his
swordfish, fitted out for the banks—for codfish,
you know—and went with him. He was to
land us at some little fishing hamlet, whose
name I have forgotten, where we were to obtain
guides and go back into the interior after caribou;
but he managed to run the schooner
ashore in a thick fog, and there we stuck until
Mars brought off a line to us. That was all
that saved us. The sailors hauled in on it, and
finally brought aboard a larger and stronger
line to which a hawser was made fast. We
took a turn with that around the capstan, and
after a good deal of hard work, succeeded in
pulling the schooner over the bar into deeper
water nearer the shore. We got off just in the
nick of time, too; for that night a storm came
up, and raised a sea that would have made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>short work with us if we had been exposed to
its fury.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Were there men on shore opposite the
place you struck?” inquired Tom.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Certainly. If there hadn’t been, who
would have tied the line to the dog’s collar and
told him to take it out to us?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I should think they would have gone to your
assistance in their boats,” replied Tom.</p>

<p class='c019'>“So they would, under ordinary circumstances;
but no boat that was ever built could
have lived a moment in the surf that was
breaking over the bar when we ran on to it. I
don’t understand to this day how Mars
managed to get through it. I have seen
him swim a good many times since that
day, and in smooth water he doesn’t seem
to be any better than any other dog. It is
when the wind is blowing and the white caps
are running that he shows what he can do.
Uncle Joe was so well pleased with the dog’s
performance that as soon as he could find his
owner, he offered to buy him. Of course the
man didn’t want to sell, but he was poor, and
when he thought of the comforts that the hundred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>dollars which uncle counted out before
him would buy for his wife and children, he
came to the conclusion that we could have the
dog. He’s mine now, for Uncle Joe gave him
to me as soon as the bargain was struck.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Did you get any caribou?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Plenty of them, and, would you believe it?
we had to take along a supply of food for that
dog the same as we did for ourselves. He
wouldn’t look at any thing except salt meat or
codfish. I really believe he would have starved
with a meal before him that would have made
any other dog’s mouth water. But he is civilized
now, and takes his rations like other white
folks. He’s got a history, Mars has, and if his
adventures and exploits were written out, they
would make a good-sized book.”</p>

<p class='c019'>A loud and hearty greeting from the two
boys who were standing on the dock in front of
the boat-house, put a stop to the conversation.
Tom and his cousins expected that the first
thing Joe Wayring did would be to acquaint
his two friends with the fact that a plot had
been formed to keep the best man from winning
at the next canoe meet, and to throw the different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>races to those who could not by any possibility
win them fairly; but again they were
disappointed. Joe did not say a word on the
subject, and the reason was because it was too
serious a matter to be discussed in the presence
of boys with whom he was so little acquainted.</p>

<p class='c019'>“A dog that will fetch a bone will carry
one,” was Joe’s mental comment. “Tom and
his cousins may be friendly to us, and then
again, if there is any truth in this report, they
may have brought it to me on account of some
spite they have against those from whom they
got it. It’s best to keep on the safe side, and
so I will hold my tongue until I have a chance
to speak to Hastings and Sheldon in private.
We have received warning, and if they beat us,
it will be our own fault.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“We were just going over to ask you three
fellows to come out and take a spin with us,”
exclaimed Hastings. “We have had our eyes
on you, and to tell you the truth, we don’t
quite like the way you handle those paddles of
yours.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Of course we don’t ask you to do your best—indeed
we would be foolish to expect it,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>chimed in Sheldon. “But still we should like
to try a few short races with you, if you don’t
mind.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“We shall be glad of the chance to see how
much we lack of being good canoeists,” said
Loren, readily. “We’ll walk back and go
around the foot of the lake—”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh, no,” interrupted Joe. “That’s too
hard work, and besides it would take up too
much time. There’s my skiff. We can put
her into the water and step the mast in a
minute, and she’ll take you over flying. Come
in here; I want to show you something. We
three belong to the committee which was
appointed to draw up a programme for the
meet,” added Joe, taking a folded paper from
a little writing desk that stood in one corner of
the boat-house, “and here’s what we shall submit
to the club at the next meeting.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom Bigden and the Farnsworth boys ran
their eyes over the paper, and the only things
they found in it that possessed any particular
interest for them were the following:</p>

<p class='c019'>“<i>Portage race.</i>—Paddle a quarter of a mile,
carry canoe twenty-five yards over a stony
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>point, re-embark and paddle back to starting
point.</p>

<p class='c019'>“<i>Single paddling race.</i>—Half a mile and
return.</p>

<p class='c019'>“<i>Hurry-Skurry race.</i>—Run ten yards, swim
twenty-five yards, paddle three hundred yards.”</p>

<p class='c019'>These were the ones, as we know, which Tom
and his cousins had “booked” themselves to
win. Then there were sailing races, tandem
races, and boys and girls’ races; and the meet
was to wind up with a greasy pole walk.</p>

<p class='c019'>“You fellows must certainly enter for that,”
said Sheldon. “You have no idea how much
sport there is in it. Some of the Mount Airy
people say that it is the best part of the performance.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom replied that he did not know just what
a greasy pole walk was, and reminded Sheldon
that he and his cousins were not yet members
of the club.</p>

<p class='c019'>“But you will be members before the day
set for the races, you may be sure of that,”
said Joe. “I’ll propose you at the next meeting,
and I know there will not be a dissenting
vote.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>“I wish you could give us the same assurance
in regard to the archery club,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c019'>“So do I, but I can’t,” answered Joe; and
then, as if that were a subject that he could
not talk about just at that time, he hastened
to add: “I can soon tell you what a greasy
pole walk is. Did you notice that high derrick
built on the end of our pier? Well, a long,
stout spar is run out from that derrick, and
after being braced and guyed so securely that
it will not sway about under any reasonable
weight, it is thickly covered with slush to make
it slippery. There is a prize of some sort at
the outer end of it, and the boy who can walk
along the pole and capture that prize before
he falls off into the water, is the best
fellow.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“What is the prize?” inquired Ralph.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Last year there were so many lucky fellows
that we had to provide several of them,” was
the reply. “The one that created the most
fun was a pig in a bag. Noble captured that,
and I tell you he had a time of it. You see,
the pig was greased as well as the pole, and
the bag was tied in such a way that when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>Noble dived for it—that was the only way he
could get hold of it, you know—the mouth of
the bag opened and the pig slipped out. Then
the uproar began. Noble, who is a plucky fellow
and a splendid swimmer, didn’t know that
the pig was greased, and he tried for a long
time to tow him ashore by one of his hind legs,
but, of course, he couldn’t do it. At last he
began to suspect something, and the way he
larruped that pig over the head with the bag to
make him turn toward the shore, was a caution.
He finally succeeded in his object, and the
instant the pig’s feet touched the beach, Noble
sprung up, threw the bag over his head and
secured him easy enough. Whatever you do,
you mustn’t miss the greasy pole walk.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I suppose we shall be laughed at if we
tumble off the pole into the water?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Certainly. That isn’t down in the programme,
but it is a part of it, all the same.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“How many trials does each contestant
have?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Only two. You see, there are so many of
us and so much fun in trying to secure the
prize, that if we didn’t set some limit to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>number of trials, the boys would keep on trying
for an indefinite length of time.”</p>

<p class='c019'>While the boys were talking in this way
they had pushed Joe’s skiff out of the boat-house
into the water, stepped the mast and
unfurled the sail that was wrapped around it.
Every thing being ready for the start, the little
fleet set out for the opposite side of the lake,
Tom and his cousins in the skiff, and Joe and
his companions in their canoes. The skiff was
made fast to Mr. Bigden’s pier, and a quarter
of an hour later three more canoes shot out of
the boat-house, and the trials of speed began.
They continued nearly all the afternoon, and
when the rival factions bade each other good-night
and paddled off toward their respective
boat-houses, there was a decided feeling of
uneasiness among some of them, while the
others were correspondingly confident and
happy.</p>

<p class='c019'>“It doesn’t seem possible that this is Bigden’s
first season in a canoe,” said Sheldon, as
soon as Tom and his cousins were out of hearing.
“He is going to crowd the best of us this
year, and if he keeps up his practice until the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>next meet, there won’t be a boy in the club
who can touch him with a ten-foot pole. He’s
going to make an expert.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I’ll just tell you what’s a fact,” said Loren,
after the canoes had been wiped out and hoisted
in their slings, “I am not so much afraid of
Joe and his crowd as I was. I don’t think
there will be any need of the fouling business.
I kept pace with Hastings in spite of all he
could do to shake me off, and could have
passed him if I had let out a little more
strength.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“That shows how much you know about
these things,” said Tom, in reply. “Do you
suppose that Hastings did the best he could?
I kept up with Joe without any very great
exertion, but I don’t crow over it. They had
plenty of speed in reserve, but you will have
to wait till the day of the races if you want
to see what they are capable of.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The sequel proved that Tom was right.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>
  <h2 class='c011'>CHAPTER VIII. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>RUNNING THE RAPIDS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c018'>“NOW that we are here by ourselves,”
continued Ralph, “I’d like to ask
you why you told Joe that the best man was
not to be allowed to win at the next meet. I
never heard of such a thing before in my life.
What do you suppose Prime and his crowd
would say to you if they should find it out?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I don’t believe they will ever find it out,”
replied Tom, who did not seem to think that he
had been guilty of any thing mean. “If I have
formed a correct estimate of Joe Wayring’s
disposition and character, he is a boy who
knows how to hold his tongue. I posted him
simply to off-set the coolness and impudence
displayed by Prime and his friends in shutting
us out of all the races, without so much as saying
by your leave. Since they would not give
us a chance to win some of the prizes, I say
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>that <i>they</i> shall not win <i>any</i> of them. We are
not going to play into the hands of boys who
work against us.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“That’s what I say,” exclaimed Loren.
“But I thought Joe acted very indifferently.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Because he did not ask me to go into the
particulars of the scheme, and give him the
names of the fellows who were in it?” said
Tom. “I thought so myself at first, but after
turning the matter over in my mind, I came to
the conclusion that his indifference was put on;
and that the reason he did not ask me to go
into details was because he was afraid I would
say to him that I was taught not to tell names
and tales too.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“It seems to me that that is about the size of
it,” Loren remarked. “But look here, Tom.
You have undertaken a pretty big contract if
you expect to keep on the right side of both
those crowds. One or the other of them will
very soon have reason to suspect you, and
then down you will go. What are you
going to do about the races?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“My proposition is, that we keep up our regular
exercise and training, and do the best we can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>to carry out our own programme, leaving
Prime’s clique and Joe’s to carry out theirs, if
they are able to do it. If we find that we stand
no show, I would much rather see Joe and his
friends win than Prime and <i>his</i> friends.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“So would I,” said Ralph. “Now I should
like to have some one tell me what excuse we
have for being down on those boys. We got
mad at them simply because they would not
break their rules and take us into their archery
club.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“And wasn’t that reason enough?” cried
Tom, hotly. “I wasn’t used to such treatment
while I lived in the city, and I won’t
submit to it now. I don’t think any more of
Hastings than I did on the day he so coolly
told me that he would not help me get into
their club. I don’t care whether he wins or
not. What I mean to say is, that Prime and
the rest shall not carry off any of the prizes if
I can help it. I intend to show them that the
next time they want any help from me,
they had better let me have a voice in making
up the programme; and I shall do it in such a
way that they can not possibly misunderstand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>me. You two can do as you please, of course;
but if you are going to weaken, I wish you
would say so at once, so that I may make
my arrangements accordingly.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Ralph and Loren hastened to assure their
cousin that they had not the slightest intention
of going back from their original agreement,
and that they would stick to him through thick
and thin, no matter what happened; but still
they wished that Tom would learn to like Joe
Wayring, and give up his idea of being
revenged upon him for slights which were
wholly imaginary. Joe had a much larger
following than Prime and Noble, through him
they could get more invitations to parties,
picnics and hunting and fishing excursions
than they could in any other way, and his
influence might eventually gain for them an
honor which they craved above all others—a
membership in the Toxophilites; for those
young ladies they met at Miss Arden’s lawn
party were handsome and stylish, that was a
fact, and Ralph and Loren had more than once
told themselves that they would even be willing
to give up their cigars, if by so doing they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>could win the privilege of shooting with those
same young ladies twice a week. If they became
intimate with George Prime, and were often seen
in his company, the Toxophilites would drop
them like so many hot potatoes; and then,
when invitations for any social gathering were
issued, they would be left out in the cold, the
same as George was. But whatever they
decided to do they must keep on the right
side of Tom, for if they did not, he would be
sure to make things unpleasant for them. It
looked as though Ralph and Loren would have
to do the very thing against which they had
cautioned their vindictive relative, that is, try
to carry water on both shoulders and take
their chances of spilling some of it.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Now we’ll take Joe’s skiff back and put it
where we found it, provided the boat-house is
open,” said Tom. “If there is any boy in the
world who ought to be supremely happy, he is
the fellow. He has every thing he can ask for,
including a rich and good-natured uncle, who
takes him off on hunting and fishing trips
nearly every year. Why that boy, young as he is,
has shot caribou and moose and caught salmon.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Yes, Joe Wayring was happy, but it was
not wholly on account of his pleasant surroundings.
His source of happiness was within
himself, and he knew it. He had been
taught that lesson at the same time that he
was being instructed in athletics and field-sports.
He thought more of others than he
did of Joe Wayring, and he would go into the
dumps in a minute if he saw any of his friends
in a disconsolate mood. If things didn’t go
right with him—and they went wrong sometimes,
as they do with every body—it made no
sort of difference with Joe’s good-nature. He
kept his troubles to himself; but Tom would
get angry and go into the sulks and make all
around him miserable. While going on the
principle that whatever is worth doing at all is
worth doing well, Joe was nevertheless perfectly
willing to be beaten by any one who could do it
fairly; but Tom wanted to be first at any cost.
This was the principal difference between the
two boys.</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom cast off the skiff’s painter while Loren
and Ralph stepped the mast and shook
out the sail, and in twenty minutes more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>they found themselves in the boat-house,
where Joe and his two friends were waiting
for them.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I saw you coming and took the cover off
one of my pets so that you could take a
look at her,” said the former, directing the
attention of his visitors to a neat cedar shell in
which he had been wont to win honors before
he became a convert to canoeing. “She has
taken me first by the judges’ boat in more than
one hotly-contested race while I was going to
school at Dartmouth Academy. Handsome,
isn’t she? No doubt you will be surprised to
hear me say it, but <i>there</i> is something that I
think more of than I do of her.”</p>

<p class='c019'>As Joe said this, he pointed toward an ungainly
looking object which lay on the floor at
the further end of the boat-house. It was a
canvas canoe, whose battered sides bore evidence
to numerous encounters with sharp-pointed
rocks and snags.</p>

<p class='c019'>“It must be on account of its associations,”
replied Loren, looking first at the clumsy
canoe and then at the clear-cut lines of the
shell. “If I had my choice between the two,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>it would not take me long to make up my mind
which one I wanted.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Of course not. There is as much difference
between them as there is between a trotter and
a plow-horse; but each one has served the purpose
for which it was intended, and served it
well, too. I like the canoe better, because she
was the first thing in the shape of a boat I ever
owned. She has carried me a good many
hundred miles, first and last, and although she
has often got contrary and spilled me out into
the water when I wasn’t expecting it, I have
had any amount of fun with her exploring
creeks and ponds that I could not otherwise
have reached. She is fourteen feet long, weighs
fifty pounds fully equipped, and packs in that
little chest you see there. I know she isn’t
very good-looking, but when it comes to running
the rapids she is there, every time. That’s
the reason I took her out of the chest. We are
going down to Sherwin’s Pond to-morrow after
bass; will you join us?”</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom and his cousins replied that they would
be glad to do so, and Joe went on to say:</p>

<p class='c019'>“You see, the fishing in the pond is better
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>than it is in the lake. The people who come
here to spend the summer do not often go
down there, because there is no wagon road
through the woods, and they are afraid to trust
themselves to the rapids. Well, they are
frightful to look at, that’s a fact, but—”</p>

<p class='c019'>“We know that very well,” interrupted
Ralph. “We have gone down there a dozen
times with our minds fully made up that we
would run those rapids, or smash our canoes in
trying, and we have as often come back without
making the attempt. When we reached
the place where the water leaves the lake, and
goes foaming and boiling over the rocks in the
gorge below, our arms always went back on
us.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Your arms?” repeated Sheldon.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Yes. Our hearts were brave enough for
any thing, but our cowardly arms wouldn’t pull
the canoes into the rapids.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh!” said Sheldon. “Well, your cowardly
arms were the wisest part of you, for you
certainly ought not to try to go through until
you know where the channel is. Those rapids
have been run hundreds of times, though not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>always without accident to be sure, and if you
will follow close in our wake to-morrow, we’ll
take you safely to the bottom.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“We must make an early start,” said Hastings,
“for we want to reach the pond just about
the time the first rays of the sun strike the
water. Can you be ready at four o’clock? All
right. Catch a good supply of minnows to-night,
and then you won’t have to waste valuable
time over it in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“And take the strongest and stiffest bait-rod
you have,” added Joe. “Leave your fly-rods,
if you have any, at home, for you will have no
use for them. About June 1st, when the bass
season opens, those who know how to throw a
fly have very fine fishing among the rocks
close to the shore; but as the weather grows
warmer the fish gradually draw off into deep
water, and all the bass we shall catch to-morrow
will be near the middle of the pond where
the springs boil up.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“And don’t forget your gun,” said Sheldon.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Nor your rubber blankets,” chimed in
Hastings.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Do you think it will rain?” asked Ralph.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>“We hope not, and indeed there are no signs
of it. When we reach the head of the rapids
we will pull off our heaviest clothing, so that
we will be ready for a swim in case we are
unlucky enough to capsize, and the things we
don’t wear we will wrap up in our rubber blankets
so that they won’t get wet.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Suppose we get down all right,” said Loren.
“How are we going to get back?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“We’ll shoulder our canoes and come up the
portage road which has been cut through the
woods around the rapids. For that reason we
don’t want to take any thing with us that we
can possibly dispense with.”</p>

<p class='c019'>After listening to a few more hints like these,
Tom and his cousins set out for the post-office;
and having secured their mail they went home
by the road that led around the foot of the
lake, running at the top of their speed all the
way through the woods to improve their wind.
Their skiff, patent minnow buckets and dip
nets were at once brought into requisition, and
by the time the supper bell rang, they had
caught bait enough to last them through a long
day’s successful angling.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Promptly at four o’clock the next morning
Tom Bigden opened the front door of the boat-house,
and waved his hat in response to a similar
signal of greeting which came to him from
over the lake. Joe Wayring and his friends
were just putting their canoes into the water.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Splendid day,” said the former, when the
two little fleets came together near the middle
of the lake. “There’s going to be just wind
enough to ripple the water, but not enough to
raise a sea, and I wouldn’t take a dollar for my
chance of catching the finest string of bass that
has been seen in Mount Airy this year.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“So say we all of us,” exclaimed Sheldon;
and this suggested the song which every school-boy
knows, but to Tom Bigden’s ill-concealed
disgust, it was sung to the words: “Joe Wayring
is a jolly good fellow,” and that was a sentiment
in which Tom did not fully concur. It
put him in bad humor for the whole of the day,
or, rather, until circumstances threw in his way
an opportunity to make that jolly good fellow
as miserable as he was himself. After that he
felt better.</p>

<p class='c019'>Under the steady motion of the sinewy arms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>which swung the long double paddles, the light
canoes made quick work with the three miles
that lay between the boat-houses and the lower
end of the lake, and presently Arthur Hastings
turned toward the nearest shore, looking over
his shoulder as he did so to call out to the
canoeists behind him:</p>

<p class='c019'>“Let’s make believe this is a hurry-skurry
race, and that there is a prize in the pond waiting
for the man who reaches the bottom of the
rapids first.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The challenge was promptly accepted. In a
twinkling the little crafts were going toward
the beach with greatly increased speed, and in
a remarkably short space of time six young
athletes, clad only in flesh-colored tights, were
prancing around their canoes, busily engaged
in wrapping their clothing in their water-proof
blankets, and lashing their rods and minnow
buckets fast so that they would not be thrown
out into the water by a heavy lurch, or even
by a capsize. Tom Bigden was the first to
shove his canoe away from the shore, but there
he had to stop. He was not acquainted with
the channel, and needed a guide to show him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>the way through; but he won the second place,
and was prompt to fall into it when Arthur
Hastings caught up his paddle and pulled away
from the beach.</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom and his cousins had often viewed the
rapids from the bank while trying in vain to
screw up courage enough to attempt their passage,
and if they looked dangerous to them
then, they looked ten times more frightful
when they surveyed them from their canoes on
this particular morning. The sight of them
was enough to make any body’s nerves quiver.
They looked as steep as the roof of a house,
and the bottom of the gorge through which
they ran, seemed to be literally covered with
bowlders. Tom could not see a single place
which looked wide enough to admit of the passage
of a canoe.</p>

<p class='c019'>“What do you think of them?” asked
Arthur, as he and Tom backed water with their
paddles to keep their canoes from taking the
plunge before they were ready.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Who was the first man who went down
here?” said Tom, in reply.</p>

<p class='c019'>“One of the hotel guides.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>“Was he a graduate of a lunatic asylum, or
did he go there afterward?” inquired Tom.</p>

<p class='c019'>Arthur laughed until the woods echoed.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Neither,” he answered, as soon as he could
speak. “He’s got a level head on his shoulders
yet, if one may judge by the constant demands
that are made upon his time. Some of the
people who come here every summer like him
so well that they begin to make bargains with
him before the ice is out of the lake. They
wouldn’t do that if they had any reason to
believe he was crazy, would they? Well,
what do you say?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I say, go ahead whenever you get ready,”
was the response.</p>

<p class='c019'>“All right,” said Arthur, who saw by the
expression on Tom’s face that he had no intention
of backing out. “Now, watch every move I
make, and let me get at least twenty or thirty
feet ahead of you before you start. Look out
for both ends of your boat. You won’t run on
to an isolated rock unless you try, because the
water runs away from it. That has a tendency
to throw the bow from the obstruction, and the
stern toward it; so the minute the bow is out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>of harm’s way, drop your paddle into the
water on the side opposite the rock, and use it
the best you know how.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why, that will throw me square upon the
rock,” cried Tom.</p>

<p class='c019'>“No, it won’t,” insisted Arthur. “It will
throw you away from danger, and the current
rushing around the rock will carry you still further
away. But if you use the paddle on the
other side, you will come up against the rock
ker-chunk; and then you will have to swim the
rest of the way down, because the stern of your
canoe will, most likely, be smashed in. Understand?”</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom replied that he did; whereupon Arthur
settled his cap more firmly on his head, took his
paddle in both hands and with one bold stroke
sent his frail craft into the rapids. The moment
the current caught him in its grasp, he began
to shoot ahead like a boy coasting down hill.
Tom shut his teeth hard and gripped his paddle
until the muscles on his bare arms stood out
like a gold-beater’s; and so intent was he upon
watching every move his guide made, that he
forgot to look out for himself, until he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>called to his senses by a warning shout from his
friends behind.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Look out, there,” yelled Joe and Roy, in
concert. “You’ll be over the brink the first
thing you know.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom heard the warning, but it came too late.
He dropped his paddle into the water and made
desperate efforts to check his canoe, which had
already gained rapid headway; but the swift
current had taken firm hold of him, and finding
that it was much stronger than he was, he
resolved to go ahead and trust to luck to keep
from running into Arthur Hastings, in case
the latter met with an accident.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Shooting the Rapids.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Tom afterward said that he did not remember
much about that wild ride. He was lost
in admiration of Arthur Hastings’s skill as a
canoeist, and followed in his wake through all
the turns he made, which were so numerous
and bewildering that Tom did not see how one
boy’s head could contain them all. It was a
lucky thing for him and his cousins that they
did not attempt to go through there without a
guide. He did not hear the waters foaming
and roaring around him, nor did he see a single
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>one of the rocks past which he went with such
speed that the wind whistled through his hair;
but he did see the smooth surface of the pond
the instant he came within sight of it, and
when he shot into it, propelled by the momentum
he had acquired during his descent of the
rapids, he called out gleefully that he had not
touched a solitary obstruction on the way.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Of course not,” answered Arthur. “If
you had, you would not be as dry as you are
now. There is a clearly defined channel all
the way through the gorge, and you won’t
touch any thing if you keep in it. What
would happen to you if you should get out of
it, I don’t know; but I think you would be
fortunate if you came off with a simple
capsize.”</p>

<p class='c019'>It was a thrilling sight that was presented
to their gaze as they sat there in their canoes at
the bottom of the rapids and watched the
others as they came down. First Joe Wayring
dashed into view around the bend, closely followed
by Ralph Farnsworth, who seemed to be
quite as much at his ease as his guide was, and
handled his paddle and managed his canoe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>quite as skillfully. By the time they reached
the smooth water at the foot Roy and Loren
came in sight, and in five minutes more the
little fleet was reunited. The hearts of three of
the canoeists beat a trifle faster than usual, but
they had accomplished the run in perfect
safety, and without a wetting, and they were
ready to try it again at the very first opportunity.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Take time to learn the channel before
attempting any thing reckless,” cautioned Joe.
“After that you can come down by yourselves
as often as you feel equal to the task of carrying
your boats back over the portage.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The boys went ashore long enough to put on
their clothes, untie their rods, and put fresh
water on their minnows, and then they were
ready for the bass.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>
  <h2 class='c011'>CHAPTER IX. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE SQUATTER TURNS UP AGAIN.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c018'>ONE fishing excursion is much like another,
and any boy who has handled a nicely-balanced
bait-rod when the black bass, perch,
and yellow pike were hungry and full of fight,
as they were on the morning of which we write,
will have a clearer idea of the sport Tom Bigden
and the rest enjoyed there on the pond
than we could possibly give him. We did not
follow them through the rapids to tell how
they played their fish and how many they
caught, and so we shall have but little to say
about it. Joe Wayring affirmed that the
twenty minutes’ fight he had with a nine pound
pike, which began in less than half a second
after he dropped his hook into the water, gave
him solid comfort and enjoyment for a week
afterward; but whether or not he found any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>comfort in something that happened when they
went ashore to eat their lunch, is another matter
altogether.</p>

<p class='c019'>About eight o’clock the fish gave notice that
they had quit business for the day by refusing
to notice any of the lures that were dropped
among them, and then the boys discovered that
their long pull before breakfast had made them
hungry.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Did you ever eat a fish that had been
baked in the ashes?” inquired Joe, addressing
himself to Tom and his cousins. “Then
you have yet one enjoyment in store for you.
You won’t think much of house-cooking after
you have eaten one of Roy’s dinners. We
know a nice place on the point above, with an
ice-cold spring handy, and we’ll—”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Excuse me for interrupting,” said Loren,
suddenly. “But did you ever see a dog like
that before?”</p>

<p class='c019'>The speaker was not a little surprised by the
effect his words produced upon some of his
companions. They all looked in the direction
indicated by his finger, and then Joe began
pulling up his anchor with almost frantic haste,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>while Arthur and Roy reached rather hurriedly
for their guns.</p>

<p class='c019'>“You can’t do any thing with him from
here,” said Joe.</p>

<p class='c019'>“And if we paddle for the shore he will see
us and take to his heels,” added Roy.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why who—what are you going to do to
him?” stammered Ralph.</p>

<p class='c019'>“We’d be glad to shoot him if we could,”
replied Joe. “He’s no dog. He’s a half-grown
bear.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom and his cousins, of course, asked a good
many questions with their lips and more with
their eyes, but Joe and his two friends were
too busy to answer them. They made all haste
to raise their anchors, and then pulled rapidly
but silently toward the shore, all the while
keeping a close watch over the movements of
the bear, which was wandering listlessly about,
now and then stopping to look into the water
or to sniff at a log, as if he were hunting for
something he had lost. Tom and his cousins
thought he looked too small for a bear, but as
he did not walk or act like a dog or any other
animal they had ever seen at large, they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>forced to conclude that he really was a bear,
and that he was in search of his breakfast.
They didn’t know whether to be afraid of him
or not; but when they saw how anxious Joe
and his two friends were to bring themselves
within shooting distance of him, they lost no
time in pulling up their own anchors and
falling in behind them. The bear, however,
was not to be taken unawares. He did not
appear to notice their approach, but he had
his eyes on them nevertheless, and when he
thought they had come close enough, he left
the beach and lumbered off into the bushes.</p>

<p class='c019'>“There!” said Tom, who was glad to see the
last of him. “He has taken himself safely off.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“We expected it,” said Roy, redoubling his
exertions at the paddle. “If we only had
Mars with us we could see more fun with him
in half an hour than we could in a week’s
fishing. He begged hard to be allowed to come,
but Joe made him stay behind. You see, he
won’t sit anywhere but in the bow, and he is
so heavy that he makes a canoe hard to manage
in rough water.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“He wouldn’t trail the bear, would he?”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>“Of course he would, and be glad of the
chance. If he found him, he would set up
such a yelping that you would think there were
a dozen dogs in the woods.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“What are you going to do now?” inquired
Ralph, as the six canoes ran their bows upon
the beach, one after the other.</p>

<p class='c019'>“We are going to stretch our legs, and that
will be a comfort after sitting in such cramped
positions for four long hours,” replied Joe, at
the same time catching up his double-barrel
and springing ashore with it. “We’ll follow
up his trail, which we can easily do for a mile
or more, because all the ground about here is
swampy, and when we lose it, we’ll knock over
a few squirrels and go up to the point and eat
our breakfast. Keep close to us, or else stay
within sight of the beach. The woods are thick,
and you could get lost without half trying.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Led by Arthur Hastings, the boys ran up the
shore of the pond until they reached the place
where the bear had turned off into the bushes,
and then the pursuit began in earnest.
Whether or not Loren and Ralph were as
anxious to get a shot at the game as they pretended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>to be, it is hard to tell; but they made
a great show of eagerness and enthusiasm, and
Tom, not wishing to be out-done, floundered
along the trail behind them. But he did not
keep his companions in sight for more than five
minutes—in fact, he didn’t mean to. He
gradually fell to the rear, and when the bushes
closed up behind Roy Sheldon, who was the
last boy on the trail, Tom sat down on a log
and thought about it.</p>

<p class='c019'>“That bear doesn’t belong to me, and I don’t
know that it is any concern of mine whether
they find him or not,” said he to himself. “It
is easier to sit here in the shade, even if one
does have to fight musquitoes, than it is to go
prancing about through a swamp where the
water, in some places, is up to the tops of a
fellow’s boots.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom suddenly brought his soliloquy to a
close and jumped to his feet. There was a
frightened expression on his face, but the
determined manner in which he gripped his gun
showed that he had no intention of running
away until he had had at least one shot at the
bear; for that it <i>was</i> the bear which occasioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>the slight rustling in the thicket a short distance
away, Tom had not the slightest doubt.
Probably the animal had made a short circuit
through the woods, and was now coming back
to the pond to finish his breakfast. While
these thoughts were passing through Tom’s
mind, the bushes toward which he was gazing
parted right and left, and a big red nose, with
a shock of uncombed hair above and a mass of
tangled brown whiskers below it, was cautiously
thrust into view, being followed a moment later
by the burly form of Matt Coyle, the squatter.
He was as ragged and dirty as ever, and carried
a heavy rifle on his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c019'>The meeting, which was entirely unexpected,
was a surprise to both of them. To tell the
truth, Tom was more alarmed when the squatter
emerged from the thicket than he would have
been if the bear had made his appearance.
Matt Coyle was very angry at the Mount Airy
people on account of the indignities they had
put upon him, and who could tell but that Tom
Bigden himself was included in the list of those
against whom he had threatened vengeance?
The squatter seemed to read the thoughts that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>were passing in the boy’s mind, for as soon as
he could speak he hastened to say:</p>

<p class='c019'>“You needn’t be no ways skeary about
meetin’ us. We ain’t forgot that you was the
only one who said a kind word to us while we
was down there”—here Matt gave his head a
backward jerk intending, no doubt, to indicate
the village of Mount Airy—“an’ of course we
ain’t got nothing agin you.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom drew a long breath of relief as he listened
to these words. Matt wouldn’t do any thing
to him, and neither would he injure any of his
property.</p>

<p class='c019'>“But as fur the rest of ’em, they had better
watch out,” continued the man, in savage
tones. “I shan’t forget ’em, an’ I’ll even up
with them some day. It may be five year, an’
it may be ten; but I’ll even up with ’em.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“What are you and your boys doing now?”
inquired Tom. He did not like the way the
squatter glared around him when he spoke of
the village people, and he wanted to turn the
conversation into another channel if he could.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Tom unexpectedly meets Matt Coyle.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>“We ain’t doin’ nothin’,” was the surly
reply, “’cause why, we ain’t got nothin’ to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>with. We ain’t got a bite of meat in the house,
an’ I was after that there b’ar when you fellers
come up an’ skeared him away. So thinks I
to myself, I’ll jest go down to the pond where
their boats is, an’ I’ll take the best one of ’em
an’ cl’ar out afore they gets back. Then I’d
have somethin’ to do with.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Where would you go?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Up to Injun Lake. I’m the bulliest kind
of a guide fur that neck of the woods, an’ so’s
my two boys; but you see we ain’t got no
boats, an’ we’re too poor to buy ’em.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why don’t you go to the hotels and hire
out to them?” demanded Tom; and then he
wondered if there were a landlord in the world
who would trust a boat-load of passengers,
ladies and children for instance, to the care of
the walking whisky barrel he saw before him.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Didn’t I try that very thing down there”—another
backward jerk of the head—“an’ didn’t
they tell me that they didn’t have no use fur
sich lookin’ fellers as me an’ my boys was?”
exclaimed Matt Coyle, fiercely. “They did
fur a fact. But if I had a boat of my own I
could go up to Injun Lake where they ain’t so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>perticular about the clothes a man wears, so
long as he understands his business, an’ I’d
make piles of money, too; ’cause why—I’d
work fur less’n the reg’lar hotel guides.
See?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Yes, I see; but how long would it be before
the regular guides would run you out, the same
as the Mount Airy people did? They would
make the country so hot for you that you
couldn’t stay there.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Suppos’n they tried that little game on?”
answered Matt, laying down his rifle long
enough to shake both his huge fists in the air.
“Ain’t that somethin’ that two can play at?
I’d break up the business of guidin’ in less’n
two seasons.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“How would you do it?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Yes, I would,” Matt went on. “If I only
had a boat that was easy to slip around in an’
light to tote over the carries, I’d make the
folks who come there fur fun so sick of them
woods that they wouldn’t never come there no
more; then what would become of them two
big hotels when there wasn’t no custom to
run ’em?”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>“How would you go about it?” repeated
Tom.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh, there’s plenty of ways,” answered the
squatter, shaking his head knowingly.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Give us one of them.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Wal, s’pos’n I should see a big party, with
childern among ’em, start out from one of them
hotels as big as life, an’ I should foller along
after ’em, easy like, an’ some day, when there
wasn’t no men folks about, I should slip up,
grab one of them childern an’ run him off to the
mountains? An’ s’pos’n one of my boys should
happen to be loafin’ around that hotel when the
party come back without the child, an’ should
hear that a reward of a hunderd, mebbe two
hunderd dollars had been offered fur his safe
return? Couldn’t my boy easy hunt me up,
an’ couldn’t I tote that young un back to his
pap an’ claim them dollars? Eh?”</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom was so astounded that he could say
nothing in reply. Matt Coyle was a great deal
worse than he thought he was. The squatter
saw that his solitary auditor was interested,
and went on to tell of another way in which he
could break up the business of guiding in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>wilderness about Indian Lake, in case the people
living there didn’t treat him and his family
as well as Matt thought they ought to be
treated.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Or s’pos’n there wasn’t no childern into the
party,” said he. “There’d be fine guns an’
fish poles an’ lots of nice grub, in course; an’
couldn’t I slip up to their camp when there
wasn’t no body there to watch it, an’ tote some
of them guns an’ things off into the bresh an’
hide ’em? Oh, there’s plenty of ways to bust
up guidin’ an’ them big hotels along with it.
They would think twice before bein’ too rough
on me, ’cause they know me up there to Injun
Lake.”</p>

<p class='c019'>And the man might have added that that
was the very reason they drove him away from
there—because they knew him.</p>

<p class='c019'>“But the trouble is, I ain’t got no boat of
my own to run about with. The punt, she’s
too heavy, an’ I ain’t got no other,” continued
Matt Coyle; and then he stopped and looked
hard at Tom, and Tom, in return, looked hard
at Matt. An idea came into his head; or, to
speak more in accordance with the facts, Tom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>suddenly recalled some words which the squatter
had let fall at the beginning of their interview.</p>

<p class='c019'>“You said you were on your way to the
pond to pick out a boat when you met me,”
said Tom. “Well, why don’t you go ahead
and get it? There is one among them that
will just suit your purpose. It is a canvas
canoe. It is very light, and you can pack it
across a four mile portage without any trouble
at all. If you don’t want to do that, you can
take it to pieces and carry it in your hand as
you would a grip-sack. It will hold up eight
hundred pounds, and you can’t over-turn it by
rocking it from side to side.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Who belongs to it?” inquired Matt, who
had never heard of such a craft before.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Joe Wayring; and his father is one of the
Mount Airy trustees. Your house was on his
land, and if Mr. Wayring had said the word,
you might have been living happily there now,
with plenty to do in the way of boating and
guiding and with money in your pocket,” said
Tom, hoping that this reference to Mr. Wayring
and the influence he might have exerted in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>Matt’s behalf, if he had seen fit to do so, would
make the squatter angry, and awaken in him a
desire to be revenged on the son since he could
not harm the father in any way. The plan
succeeded admirably. Matt laid his rifle on the
ground so that he could shake both his fists,
and the oaths and threats he uttered when he
had thus relieved himself of all incumbrance,
were frightful to hear. He did not yell, as he
would like to have done, for he knew that the
boys who had gone in pursuit of the bear were
not far away; but he hissed out the words
between his clenched teeth, and kicked and
trampled down the bushes in his rage.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I’d take the boat now, even if I knowed it
wouldn’t be of no use to me,” said he, as
soon as he could speak. “It’ll cost ole man
Wayring five an’ mebbe twenty dollars to buy
him another—”</p>

<p class='c019'>“More than that,” said Tom. “A good
deal more.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Wal, it’ll be jest that much out of his
pocket whatever it is,” answered Matt Coyle.
“Where did you say them boats was?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Right down there on the beach,” replied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>Tom, indicating the direction with his finger.
“You know which one I mean, don’t you?
You’re sure you can tell a canvas canoe from
a Shadow or a Rob Roy?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Am I sure that I can tell a pipe from a shot
gun?” retorted Matt.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Yes, I suppose you can do that, but I am
not so positive that you can tell one canoe
from another,” answered Tom. “Of course it
wouldn’t be safe for me to go down to the
beach with you, for if Joe should happen to be
anywhere within sight, I’d be in a pretty fix.
You may be sure I shall not so much as hint
that I saw you here in the woods, and you
mustn’t lisp it to a living person.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Course not,” said Matt. “Mum’s the word
between gentlemen.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom could scarcely restrain an exclamation
of disgust. It looked as though this blear-eyed
ragamuffin considered himself quite as
good as the boy he was talking to.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Take the canoe just as it stands,” continued
Tom, “and you will find a good lunch as
well as a fine fishing-rod in it. Be lively now,
for Joe may come back at any moment. I’ll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>keep out of sight, for of course I don’t want to
know any thing about it.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I don’t care fur them new-fangled poles
what’s got a silver windlass onto the ends of
’em, an’ I wouldn’t tech it if I didn’t think I
could sell it to somebody; but I’ll go fur the
grub, I tell you.”</p>

<p class='c019'>So saying Matt Coyle went through with some
contortions with the left side of his face which
were, no doubt, intended for a friendly farewell
wink, and stole off toward the beach; while
Tom turned and walked away in the opposite
direction. When he thought he had put a safe
distance between himself and the pond, he sat
down to await developments. Nor was he
obliged to wait long. A rifle cracked away off to
the left of his place of concealment, then a shot
gun roared, and presently voices came to him
from the depths of the forest. Joe and his companions
had given up the chase, and were now on
their way back to the pond, shooting squirrels
as they came. Tom knew when they
passed by within less than a hundred yards of
him, and he knew, too, that they were surprised
because they did not meet him in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>woods or find him on the beach, for they set up
a series of dismal whoops as soon as they
reached the water’s edge.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Now for it,” thought Tom, drawing his
hand over his face and looking as innocent
as though he had never been guilty of
a mean act in his life. “I’ve got to meet them
some time, and it might as well be now as an
hour later. Whoop-pee!” he yelled in answer
to the shouts that were sent up from the
shore of the pond.</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom’s ears also told him when Joe Wayring
first discovered that his canvas canoe was missing.
The yells suddenly ceased, and Tom
heard no more from Joe and his companions
until he came out of the woods and halted on
the beach a short distance from the place where
they were standing. They were gathered in a
group around Roy Sheldon, who was bent over
with his hands on his knees, and his eyes fastened
upon a foot-print in the mud. They
were listening so eagerly to something Roy
was saying, that Tom walked up within reach
of them before any of the group knew that he
was about.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>“What have you found that is so very interesting?”
inquired Tom, who knew that he
ought to open the conversation in some way.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh, here you are,” exclaimed Hastings.
“We could not imagine what had become of
you. Until we heard you call out there in the
woods, we supposed that the bear had come
back, and that you had gone after him in Joe’s
boat.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Not by a long shot!” cried Tom, who saw
very plainly what Arthur was driving at. “I
haven’t seen the bear since I lost sight of you,
and if I had, I should have gone away from him
and not toward him. I have no ambition to
shine as a bear hunter, and consequently I am
here safe and sound.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“But Joe’s canoe isn’t,” said Roy.</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom looked, and sure enough the place
where Joe had left his boat when he went into
the woods was vacant. With much apparent
anxiety and uneasiness he turned toward his
canoe as if to satisfy himself that his own
treasures were safe, when Roy broke out
with—</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh, you’re a sufferer the same as the rest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>of us. Your lunch and your fine bait-rod
have gone off to keep Joe’s canoe company.
He took all our rods and his pick of the fish,
too, and it is a great wonder to me that he was
good enough to leave us our paddles.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom was really surprised now, and he was
deeply in earnest when he said:</p>

<p class='c019'>“If I ever meet the man who did that I’ll have
him arrested if I can find any one to make out
a warrant for him.” Then suddenly recollecting
that he was not supposed to know who the
thief was, he added: “Do you suspect any
body?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“No, we don’t suspect; we know,” answered
Joe. “Look at that!”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Can you tell a man’s name by looking at
the print of his foot in the mud?” asked
Tom.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I can tell that man’s name, for I know how
he was shod the last time I saw him,” replied
Joe. “It was Matt Coyle. He made a good
many threats before he left the village, and he
has begun to carry them out already. He has
put up his shanty somewhere in the vicinity
of this pond, and will make it his business to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>do some damage to every hunting and fishing
party that comes here.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, what are we standing here for?”
exclaimed Tom, who had expected before this
time to hear somebody propose an immediate
pursuit of the robber.</p>

<p class='c019'>“We might as well stay here and take it
easy, as to get wild and rush around through
the woods for nothing,” replied Joe; and Tom
was surprised to see how ready he was to give
his boat up for lost. “In the first place, we
couldn’t overtake the robber, and in the
second, we couldn’t recover our property if we
did. The day of reckoning will surely come,
but we can’t do any thing to hasten it.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The idea that the squatter would disturb
any of the things in the other canoes had never
entered into Tom’s mind. Matt seemed to
remember, with as much gratitude as such a
man was capable of, that Tom was one of the
few who sympathized with him when he was
ordered out of Mount Airy, and yet he had
made little distinction between his property
and that belonging to the sons of the trustees
who ordered him away. There was no sham
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>about his rage. He was angry because his
elegant rod and German silver bass reel had
disappeared, and because he knew that he
would never dare have Matt Coyle arrested for
the theft. If the latter should go before a
magistrate and repeat the words that had
passed between Tom and himself not more than
half an hour ago, wouldn’t he be in a pretty
scrape? He was in one already, for the squatter
had a hold upon him, and subsequent events
proved that Matt knew how to use it to his
own advantage.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c018'>“HOW in the world did you manage to
get separated from us so quickly?”
asked Roy, addressing himself to Tom Bigden.
“The last time I saw you, you were bringing
up the rear all right, but when we lost the
trail and stopped to hold a consultation, you
were not to be seen.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom had been expecting this, and he was
ready with his answer. Pointing to his boots,
which he had purposely stuck into a mud-hole,
shortly after his companions left him, he said:</p>

<p class='c019'>“I got mired in the swamp, and by the time
I could crawl out and pour the water from my
boots, you had left me so far behind that I
could neither see nor hear any thing of you.
If I had come directly back to the pond instead
of wasting time in looking for you, I might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>have been able to stop Matt Coyle’s raid on
our canoes.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I doubt it very much,” replied Joe Wayring.
“No doubt Matt has been watching us
all the morning and waiting for us to come
ashore so that he could steal something, and I
believe he would have made his ‘raid’ if we
had all been here to oppose him. As it was, he
had full swing, and there are none of us hurt.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“That’s my idea,” said Arthur. “Judging
by his countenance Matt is a bad man and a
desperate one. Well, we have lost our rods
and reels, which must be worth considerably
more than a hundred dollars, but we have
learned one thing, that we ought to profit by,
and another that we can use to our advantage.
To begin with, so long as Matt Coyle is allowed
to stay about in this neck of the woods—”</p>

<p class='c019'>“And I guess he’ll stay here as long as he
has a mind to,” observed Roy.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, I guess he won’t,” retorted Arthur.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I know what you mean,” said Roy. “You
mean that the arm of the law is strong enough
to snatch him out of the swamp. I don’t dispute
it. The trouble is going to be to get hold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>of him. If he finds the low lands getting too
warm for him, he will take to the mountains;
and you know that there are a good many
places among them where a white man has
never yet set his foot.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“He’ll come out, all the same,” answered
Arthur; “but as long as he stays around,
Sherwin’s Pond is no place for hunting and
fishing parties, unless they bring some one
with them to watch the camp while they are
rambling about in the woods. We must warn
the hotel people as soon as we get back to
town.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“You said there was something we could
use to our advantage,” suggested Joe.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Yes. We can see any amount of sport
here this fall with the grouse. We flushed a
lot of them while we were gone,” he added,
turning to Tom, “but of course we didn’t shoot
at them.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why not?” inquired the latter.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why, because the close season isn’t over
yet, and the birds are protected by law.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom and his cousins had nothing to say, but
they wondered if Arthur Hastings always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>obeyed the game laws when he was alone in the
woods. They had not much respect for him if
he did. They could not lay claim to any great
skill themselves. An October grouse on the
wing would have been as safe from harm a
dozen yards away from the muzzles of their
double-barrels, as though he had been on the
other side of the globe. They always killed
their game sitting; and they would shoot at a
robin as soon as they would shoot at a wild
turkey.</p>

<p class='c019'>“We didn’t come down here to go home
hungry,” said Joe, pointing to a bunch of
squirrels that lay at the foot of the nearest
tree. “We’ll have two courses to our dinner
or breakfast, or whatever you call a meal eaten
at this time of day, and there’s plenty of water
in the spring to wash it down with.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The boys were all hungry, and there was
nothing appetizing in looking forward to a
breakfast of meat and fish. Joe Wayring and
his friends did not mind it, for they had eaten
many such meals during their vacation wanderings
in the woods; but Tom Bigden was not
much accustomed to roughing it, and he condemned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>the squatter almost as bitterly for
walking off with the hard-boiled eggs, sardines,
canned fruit and bottle of cold coffee, which he
had provided as his share of the common
dinner, as he did for stealing his fishing-rod.</p>

<p class='c019'>“When Matt opens my bundle and finds all
that buttered tissue paper in it I guess he’ll
wonder,” said Joe, as he stepped into Roy’s
canoe and picked up one of the joints of the
double paddle. “He won’t know what I
intended to do with it; do you, Bigden?”</p>

<p class='c019'>After a little reflection Tom concluded that
he couldn’t tell what use the buttered tissue
paper could be put to, unless Joe intended to
start a fire with it, and the latter went on to
explain.</p>

<p class='c019'>“We always take a supply with us as a substitute
for a frying-pan,” said he. “After
cleaning the fish in good shape, we wrap him
up in this tissue paper, and then add three or
four thicknesses of wet brown paper. In the
meantime, the fellow whose business it is to
see to the fire has taken care to have a nice bed
of coals ready. We rake these coals apart,
put in the fish, and cover him up so quickly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>that the paper around him has no time to get
afire, and there he stays until he is done.
Then we poke him out, and when the paper is
taken off the skin and scales come with it; and
if you relish a well-cooked fish, there he is.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“But how do you know when the fish is
done?” asked Ralph.</p>

<p class='c019'>“A potato is as good a clock as you want to
go by,” answered Joe.</p>

<p class='c019'>“A potato?” repeated Ralph.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Yes. I brought several with me, intending
to put them on the table after they had done
duty as clocks, but they have gone off with the
sugar, lemons and other good things I had in
my bundle. As soon as your fish is covered
up in the coals,” continued Joe, “put your
potatoes in alongside of him and cover them
up also. You can test them with a sharp stick
at any time, and when they are done, which
will be at the end of half an hour, if your fire
is just right, poke them out, break them open
and place them on a flat stone which you have
previously washed, to cool. Then poke out
your fish, take off the wrappings and fall to
work. But we shall have to use boards this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>trip—there are plenty of them lying around
loose on the point, unless Matt Coyle has carried
them off to patch up his shanty—and
make our noses do duty as clocks.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom did not understand this, either; but
believing that he had made a sufficient airing
of his ignorance of woodcraft for one day, at
least, he asked no more questions.</p>

<p class='c019'>Half an hour’s steady paddling brought the
boys to the point, on which they landed to
prepare their meager breakfast. That it was a
favorite resort for parties like their own was
evident. Beds of ashes surrounding the mossy
bowlder from beneath which the spring bubbled
up, marked the places where roaring camp-fires
had once been built, and the empty fruit
and meat cans that had been tossed into the
bushes told what good dinners had been eaten
there.</p>

<p class='c019'>Joe Wayring at once set off to hunt up a
couple of suitable boards, another started a
fire, two more fell to work upon the fish and
squirrels, and the rest found employment in
gathering a supply of fuel, and providing birch-bark
plates and platters. Although Tom and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>his cousins did their full share of the work,
they did not neglect to keep an eye on their
more experienced companions; and they were
astonished to see how easily one can get on
without a good many things which the majority
of people seem to think necessary to their
very existence. When the fish had been
cleaned and washed in the pond, they were
spread out flat and fastened with wooden pins
to the boards, which were propped up in front
of the fire; while the squirrels were impaled
upon forked sticks and held over the coals by
Arthur Hastings and Roy, who turned first
one side and then the other to the heat, until
they were done to a delicious brown.</p>

<p class='c019'>“If Matt Coyle had only been good enough
to leave us the bacon, which I was careful to
have put up with my lunch, these squirrels
would be much better than they are going to
be,” said Arthur, addressing himself to Ralph,
who manifested the greatest interest in this
rude forest cookery. “Their meat is rather
dry, you know, and a strip of nice fat bacon
pinned to each side of them would furnish the
necessary grease—that isn’t a very elegant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>word, I know, but it expresses my meaning all
the same—and give them a flavor also. It
would make the fish more palatable, too. My
advice to you is, always take a chunk of bacon
with you if you are going to cook your dinner
in the woods.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“What’s he doing?” inquired Ralph, nodding
toward Joe Wayring, who stood around
with his hands in his pockets, now and then
elevating his chin and sniffing the air like a
pointer that had struck a fresh scent.</p>

<p class='c019'>Arthur laughed heartily.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Joe’s timing the fish,” was his reply.
“When they smell so good that he can’t wait
any longer, he will know they are done; and
then dinner will be ready. It’s rather a
novel way, I confess, but Joe hits it every
pop.”</p>

<p class='c019'>This was the first time that Tom and his
cousins had ever sat down to a meal that was
composed of nothing but fish and meat, but it
tasted much better than they thought it would.
Perhaps the reason was because they were
hungry. At any rate they disposed of all that
was placed before them, and would have asked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>for another piece of squirrel if there had been
any more on the big slice of bark that did duty
as a platter.</p>

<p class='c019'>“This meal will give you an idea of what we
could have done if that squatter had not
stumbled on our canoes while we were after
that bear,” said Roy, who stood holding the
empty platter in one hand and his light bird
gun in the other. As he spoke, he sent the
platter flying over the pond, and broke it into
inch pieces by the two charges of shot he put
into it before it struck the water. “What’s
the next thing on the programme?” he continued.
“I don’t much like the idea of undertaking
that long carry during the heat of the
day, but I don’t see what else we can do unless
we are willing to stay here and be idle for
hours to come. We can’t fish any more, that’s
certain. We haven’t brought our long bows
with us, and who wants to shoot squirrels with
a shot gun? Not I, for one.”</p>

<p class='c019'>There was no debate upon the question Roy
had raised. They had their choice between
going home, and staying where they were until
the sun sank out of sight behind the mountains;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>and they were not long in making up
their minds what they would do. When Joe
Wayring picked up his gun and stepped into
Roy’s canoe (it was a Rice Laker, and not
being decked over, it could easily accommodate
him and its owner), the others got into
theirs, and the fleet started toward the upper
end of the pond.</p>

<p class='c019'>We have said that Mirror Lake and Sherwin’s
Pond were fifteen miles apart, and that
there were about twelve miles of rapids in the
stream by which they were connected. This,
of course, would leave three miles of still water;
but the trouble was, it could not be made use of
by any one going from the pond to the lake.
At every one of the points at which the rapids
ceased and the stretches of still water began,
the banks were high and steep, and so
densely covered with briers and bushes that
the most active boy would have found it a difficult
task to work his way to the water’s edge,
and an impossible one if he had a canoe on his
back. This being the case our six friends had
a long portage (they generally called it a
“carry”) to look forward to; but three of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>them, at least, went at it as they went at every
thing else that was hard—with the determination
to do it at once and have it over with.
Arthur Hastings went first with his little Rob
Roy on his back, Joe Wayring followed close
behind him with all the guns and paddles he
could carry (the rest of them were lashed fast
in the cock-pits so that they would not fall out
when the canoes were turned bottom up), and
they led their companions nearly a third of the
distance before they put down their loads
and leaned up against a tree to rest.</p>

<p class='c019'>“This is my last visit to Sherwin’s pond
this season,” panted Arthur, as he drew his
handkerchief from his pocket and wiped the big
drops of perspiration from his forehead. “It’s
too much sugar for a cent—altogether too
much.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Every time you come through here on a
hot day you say the same thing,” observed Joe.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I know it; but I am in dead earnest now.
The game isn’t worth the candle.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“What’s the matter? Are you sorry that
you didn’t smash your canoe in the rapids?”
asked Roy.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>“Or didn’t you catch fish enough to suit
you?” chimed in Ralph.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Perhaps he is disgusted because he didn’t
shoot that bear,” said Joe.</p>

<p class='c019'>“It’s hard work,” repeated Arthur. “The
fun of running the rapids, catching a nice
string of bass and seeing a bear, does not
repay one for the horrors of this fifteen mile
carry. It is worse for me to-day than it ever
was before, because we have been so very
unlucky. We have used our rods for the last
time, and Joe will never see his canvas canoe
again.”</p>

<p class='c019'>This was the way in which Arthur and his
two friends referred to their losses whenever
they referred to them at all. There was no
unreasonable exhibition of rage, such as Tom
Bigden would have been glad to indulge in, if
he could have found the least excuse for so
doing.</p>

<p class='c019'>If Tom had possessed even the semblance of
a heart, it would have smote him when he saw
how patiently Joe and his chums bore up under
their misfortunes. If Matt Coyle had turned
the matter over in his mind for a whole month,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>he could not have hit upon anything that was so
well calculated to render these three boys
miserable, as was the piece of villainy which
he had that day carried out at the suggestion
of Tom Bigden. Tom was glad of one thing:
His companions did not ask him any questions,
and consequently he was not obliged to tell
them any lies.</p>

<p class='c019'>The boys rested a good many times while
they were on the carry, and when at last they
launched their canoes on the broad bosom of the
lake they were so weary and devoid of ambition,
that it was a task for them to paddle down to
the boat-houses; but, like their arduous journey
across the portage, it was accomplished at
last by steady and persevering effort, and when
they separated near the middle of the lake and
pulled away toward their respective homes,
they told one another that the next time they
went down to the pond they would see to it
that Matt Coyle had no chance to spoil their
day’s sport.</p>

<p class='c019'>“There’s something about that business that
don’t look just right to me,” said Ralph Farnsworth,
as soon as Joe and his friends were out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>of hearing. “I don’t mind my own loss, but I
am really sorry for Joe Wayring.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“So am I,” said Loren. “He prized that
canoe very highly. I believe he would rather
have lost his handsome breech-loader. I tell
you we made a mistake in having any thing to
do with George Prime. Wayring and his
crowd are much the better lot of fellows.”</p>

<p class='c019'>These remarks settled one thing to Tom
Bigden’s satisfaction. Ever since his interview
with the squatter he had been asking himself
whether or not he ought to take his
cousins into his confidence, and now he knew
that he had better not. He was afraid, as well
as ashamed, to show them how far his unreasonable
enmity toward Joe Wayring had led
him, and so he said nothing.</p>

<p class='c019'>Great was the indignation among some of
the Mount Airy people when it became known
that Matt Coyle had turned up again when he
was least expected, and that he had walked off
with a hundred and fifty dollars worth of property
that did not belong to him. But Mount
Airy, as we have seen, was like other places in
that it numbered among its inhabitants certain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>evil-minded and envious persons, who were
never so happy as when they were listening to
the story of some one’s bad luck. George
Prime and the boys who made their head-quarters
in his father’s store were delighted
to hear that the squatter had begun operations
against Joe and his chums, and hoped he
would “keep it up” until he had stolen or
destroyed every thing they possessed. They
declared that they were sorry for Tom and his
cousins, but when they came to say that much
to them by word of mouth, as they did the next
afternoon when Tom, Ralph and Loren dropped
into the drug-store on their way to the
post-office, they did it in such a way that Tom
became disgusted, and left without buying the
cigar he had intended to ask for.</p>

<p class='c019'>“The more I see of those fellows, the less I
like them,” said Tom; and then he was about
to open his battery of abuse upon Prime and
his friends, when he discovered several of the
Toxophilites coming down the side-walk. “I’ll
tell you what’s a fact, boys,” Tom added in a
lower tone. “It’s a lucky thing for us that
we didn’t buy those cigars. Here comes Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>Arden with a whole crowd of girls, and there
isn’t a street or alley that we could slink into
if we had a weed in our hands.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The boys lifted their hats as the girls came
up, and passed on rejoicing over their escape.
If they had been caught in the act of smoking
they might have said good-by to all their hopes
of getting into the archery club. A little further
on they stopped in front of the window of a
jewelry store, where some of the prizes that
were to be distributed at the canoe meet had
been placed for exhibition. Their three companions
of the previous day were there, and
their attention was concentrated upon a beautiful
blue silk flag, trimmed with gold fringe and
bearing in its center the monogram of the Mount
Airy canoe club, which occupied a conspicuous
position among the prizes.</p>

<p class='c019'>“That’s some of Miss Arden’s handiwork,”
said Joe Wayring, after he had cordially
greeted Tom and his cousins. “It is to go to
the first one who walks the greasy pole.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Great Moses!” ejaculated Tom. “To
what base uses—”</p>

<p class='c019'>“That’s just what I said,” interrupted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Arthur Hastings. “I told her, too, that it
wouldn’t make half the fun the greasy pig did,
and you ought to have seen her stick up her
nose. Another thing, now that I think of it:
Unless the wind is just right, the flag will
wallop itself over and around the pole until it
is all covered with grease.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“And the boy who is lucky enough to capture
it will have to take it into the water with
him, and there is her elegant prize ruined at
the start,” chimed in Joe Wayring.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Don’t you think Miss Arden had wit
enough to provide for that?” exclaimed Mr.
Yale, the jeweler, who happened to overhear
this remark. “Do you see that little flag
beside the blue one? Well, that is intended
to represent the prize. If you are fortunate
enough to capture that, you can fly the blue
pennant at your masthead.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Miss Arden was right when she told her
friends that she was sure that the gallant fellows
who belonged to the canoe club would
work harder for her flag than they would for a
greasy pig. Every one of the boys who stopped
in front of Mr. Yale’s window that afternoon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>to look at the prizes, told himself that if
he did not win that flag it would be because
some lucky member walked off with it before
he had a chance to try for it.</p>

<p class='c019'>During the next two weeks little or nothing
happened in or about Mount Airy that is
worthy of note. A deputy sheriff and constable
went down to Sherwin’s Pond to arrest Matt
Coyle, and, after a three days’ search returned
empty-handed. They found the place where
the squatter had built his shanty, but it was
gone when they got there, and so were Matt
and his family. The authorities at Indian
Lake were requested to keep a look-out for
him, but Matt was too old a criminal to be
easily caught. He and his boys offered themselves
as guides to the guests of the hotels, but
when they were told that they were not wanted,
they set themselves to work to carry out the
programme of which Matt had spoken to Tom
Bigden on the day he stole Joe Wayring’s canoe—that
is, to break up the business of guiding
in the region about Indian Lake, and to make
the people who came there for recreation so
sick of the woods that they would never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>come there again. Whether or not they
succeeded in their object shall be told further
on.</p>

<p class='c019'>Tom Bigden and his cousins never knew how
near they came to being black-balled when their
names were brought before the canoe club at
its next meeting. Prime and his friends were
suspicious of Tom. The latter kept away from
the drug-store altogether; he and his cousins
were often seen in Joe Wayring’s company, and
Prime said that looked as though Tom wasn’t
in earnest when he promised to assist in carrying
out the arrangements that had been made
for defeating Joe and Arthur at the coming
canoe meet.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I’ll vote for him,” said Prime, after Noble,
Scott, and one or two others had labored with
him for a long time, “but if he plays us false,
as I really think he means to do, he can just
hang up his fiddle, so far as the Toxophilites
are concerned. I’ll take pains to let Miss Arden
and the rest of the girls know that he and his
cousins smoke and play billiards and cards on
the sly, and they’ll make dough of his cake in
short order.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>“The agony is over at last,” said Tom, after
Joe Wayring and his inseparable companions
Arthur and Roy, who came over in the <i>Young
Republic</i> the next morning to announce the
result of the ballot, had gone home again.
“Bear in mind, now, that we are to stick to
our original programme and win if we can. If
we find that we have no show, and that the
prizes must go to Wayring and his friends, or
to Prime and his followers, we’ll stand by
Wayring every time. We’ll teach that drug-store
crowd that the next time they make up
a slate they had better put our names on it if
they expect us to help them.”</p>

<p class='c019'>It never occurred to Tom and his cousins that
possibly Joe Wayring, and all the other boys
who believed that friendly trials of strength
and skill, like those that were to come off during
the canoe meet, should be fairly conducted,
would not thank them for their interference.
Joe had warned all his friends that there were
boys in the club who had been “booked” to
win by fair means or foul (of course he did not
tell them where he got his information), and
they made some pretty shrewd guesses as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>who those boys were. Being forewarned they
were forearmed, and they did not want any
help. Tom found it out on the day the races
came off.</p>

  <h2 class='c011'>CHAPTER XI. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE CANOE MEET.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_5 c018'>THE first thing the members of the canoe
club did when they sprang out of bed on
the morning of the second day of August, was
to run to the window, draw aside the curtain
and take a look at the sky and the lake. The
one was cloudless, and the surface of the other
was rippled by a little breeze which promised,
by the time the sun was an hour high, to freshen
into a capital sailing wind. For all the members
of the club were not so deeply interested
in the paddle, portage and hurry-skurry races
as Joe Wayring and Tom Bigden were. A few
of them were expert sailors, and anxious to
show the spectators (there would be more
strangers among them this year than ever
before), how skillfully they could manage their
cranky little boats when they were under canvas.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>The young athletes were all in excellent
training, and there was not one among them
who did not expect to win a prize of more or
less value during the day. Some of the canoeists
had discovered a couple of Yale college
students among the guests at the Mount Airy
House, and after a little urging they had consented
to assume the management of affairs,
one as judge and the other as referee. They
knew all about the rules of boating, and Joe
Wayring told himself, that Prime and his
friends would have to be smarter than he
thought they were if they could play any tricks
under the watchful eyes of those two college
men without being caught in the act.</p>

<p class='c019'>At an early hour Mr. Wayring’s spacious
boat-house, which was to be used as head-quarters
and had been handsomely decorated for the
occasion, was thrown open, and shortly afterward
the members of the club began to arrive.
They drew their canoes upon the beach at the
side of the boat-house and disappeared in the
dressing-room, where they remained until the
warning blast of a bugle notified them that it
was time to begin operations. Now and then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>one of them would take a cautious peep out at
the back door and turn around to inform his
companions that all New London had come up
to attend the meet; and although they knew
that there were a good many people assembled
to witness the sports, they were all surprised,
and not a few of them were made nervous by
the scene that was presented to their gaze when
they sprang off the wharf, and ran to push
their canoes into the water. Mr. Wayring’s
grounds were crowded with gayly dressed spectators,
who where lounging on the grass or sitting
comfortably under the tents that had been
provided for them, and the lake was covered
with sail and row boats, all of which were flying
as many flags as they could find places
for.</p>

<p class='c019'>A mile up the lake the stake-boat was anchored.
In it was one of the judges, who reclined
at his ease on a couch of cushions with an awning
over him to keep off the sun. The other
judge was Mr. Hastings, who stood on the
wharf to act as starter. The referee’s barge,
propelled by six of the best oarsmen that could
be found among the guides, lay off the wharf,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>and the police-boats had already cleared the
course.</p>

<p class='c019'>“All you young gentlemen who are to compete
in this race draw a number as you pass,
and station yourselves accordingly,” said Mr.
Hastings, who held a small tin box above his
head so that the contestants could not look into
it and pick a number instead of taking it at
random. “Go down as far as the leaning tree
so as to get a good start, and fill away at the
sound of the bugle, No. 1 taking the outside.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The first event was a sailing race—two miles
with a turn. Those who had entered for it
drew a number from the box, lingered a moment
to look at the swinging silver pitcher and
gold-lined goblets, which, with a tray to hold
them, were to go to the boy who sent his canoe
first across the line on the home stretch, and
then ran out to launch their canoes and hoist
their sails. There were ten starters, and they
made a pretty picture as they came up the
lake before the fresh breeze that was then blowing,
and dashed across the imaginary line that
marked the beginning of the course. Another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>blast from the bugle warned them that it was
a “go,” and the race was begun.</p>

<p class='c019'>The sound of the bugle seemed to
excite every body—the people on shore
as well as the boys in the boats, who
crowded their cranky little crafts until it
looked as if some of them must certainly
go over. There were several of Prime’s
friends among the contestants, and Joe and
his two chums wondered if any one of them
had been “booked” to come out ahead in this
particular race. They saw nothing to indicate
it. There was no attempt to foul the boy who
seemed likely to win, and indeed there was no
chance for any such proceeding. The referee’s
barge easily kept abreast of the racers, and the
man in the stake-boat kept his glass directed
toward them from the start. There was some
crowding and confusion at the turn, and some
of the little vessels came dangerously near to
one another; but their crews made desperate
efforts to clear themselves, some because they
knew they were closely watched, and others
because they were determined to win fairly or
not at all, and the race was not interrupted.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>It was a close and exciting struggle, and the
boy who brought his Rice Laker first across the
line was fairly entitled to the silver pitcher.</p>

<p class='c019'>“That was a splendid race,” exclaimed Joe
Wayring, as the contestants, after beaching
their canoes, came into the boat-house to listen
to the congratulations, or to receive the sympathy
of their friends. “The paddle race
comes off now, and I hope that those of us who
take part in it will make as good a showing as
you did.”</p>

<p class='c019'>While Joe was talking in this way, Ned
Stewart, one of the boys who had just been
defeated, drew a few of his friends around him
in a remote corner of the boat-house by
intimating to them in a mysterious way that
he had something of importance to say to
them.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Look here, Bigden,” said Ned, in an
excited whisper. “I believe it is understood
that some of us are to foul Wayring or any
fellow in his crowd who stands a chance of
winning, and give Noble a chance to carry off
the honors of the paddle race?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I believe you did make some such arrangement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>as that,” replied Tom, indifferently.
“But if my memory serves me, you did not
consult me in regard to it.”</p>

<p class='c019'>These words produced the utmost consternation
among the boys in the corner.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Are you going back from your word?”
cried Noble, as soon as he could speak.</p>

<p class='c019'>“What do you mean by that?” demanded
Tom.</p>

<p class='c019'>“You know very well what he means,”
exclaimed Bob Lord, who, it will be remembered,
had been “booked” to win the upset
race. “Now, look here, Bigden: You have
been running with Wayring a good deal, of late,
and we might have expected this of you. You
want Wayring to win because you think he can
do more to get you into the archery club than
we can; but I assure you that you are mistaken
there. You can’t get in without our
votes, and if you go back on us we shan’t give
them to you.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I don’t want Wayring to win,” said Tom,
emphatically. “My Cousin Loren is going to
come out at the top of the heap in this race.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, I’ll bet you a dollar he isn’t,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>exclaimed Noble, whose flashing eyes showed
how angry he was. “If I don’t win this race
nobody shall.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, I’ll bet you two dollars that I shall
keep pretty close to Loren, and that the boy
who interferes with him purposely will go out
of his canoe in less time than he can say
‘General Jackson’ with his mouth open.
Not only that, but I’ll thrash him the very first
time I can catch him ashore,” replied Tom,
returning Noble’s angry scowl with interest,
and doubling up his fists as if he were ready
and willing to put his threat into execution
then and there.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Look here! Look here, boys,” whispered
Prime, who was really afraid the two would
come to blows. “Such work as this will never
do. If we quarrel among ourselves, Wayring
and his crowd will walk off with all the prizes
as they have always done.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I have no intention of quarreling,” said
Noble, who did not like the way Tom glared
at him. “I only want Bigden to keep his
promise.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“What promise?” demanded Tom.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>“Why, didn’t you say that you were down
on Wayring and Hastings, and that you did
not want to see them win any of the races?”
inquired Scott.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I did.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“And didn’t you promise that you would
help <i>us</i> win?” chimed in Frank Noble.</p>

<p class='c019'>“No, I didn’t. When you told me what
your programme was, I simply said: ‘All
right.’ By that I meant that you could do as
you pleased, and my cousins and I would do
as <i>we</i> pleased. You were very good to yourselves
when you picked out all the best races
for your own men, and left us out in the cold,
were you not? We do not consider that we
are under obligations to abide by any such
arrangement, and we shan’t do it. We’ve got
a programme of our own that we mean to carry
out if we can, and the fellow who interferes
with us in any way may make up his mind to
take the consequences.”</p>

<p class='c019'>So saying Tom walked off followed by his
cousins, leaving Prime and his companions lost
in wonder.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Serves us just right for having any thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>to do with such upstarts,” said Noble, who was
the first to speak. “They have gone back on
us fair and square; that’s easy enough to be
seen.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Who ever heard of such impudence?”
exclaimed Prime. “They came to Mount Airy
with the idea that they could run the town to
suit themselves, and because they can’t do it,
they are mad about it. They must not be
allowed to win a race. I would much rather
see Wayring or Hastings come in first.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“That brings me to what I wanted to say to
you,” said Ned Stewart. “I don’t know
whether or not that college man in the stake-boat
suspects any thing, but he certainly
acted like it. He kept his eyes on us from the
time we crossed the line until we got home.
If you try to foul any body you must be very
sly about it, or else you will be caught and
ruled out.”</p>

<p class='c019'>If Stewart had any thing else to say he did
not have time to say it, for just then the bugle
sounded another warning, and that put a stop
to the conversation. It was a call to the boys
who were to take part in the paddle race. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>few seconds later thirteen active young fellows
in showy uniforms sprang off the wharf one after
the other, shoved their canoes into the water,
and paddled away to take the positions assigned
them by the numbers they had drawn from the
tin box. As luck would have it, Tom Bigden
found himself near the center of the line, with
his Cousin Loren on one side of him and Frank
Noble on the other. Joe Wayring was on the
right, nearest the shore, and Arthur Hastings
on the extreme left, near the middle of the
lake.</p>

<p class='c019'>“It’s a bad outlook for us,” whispered Loren,
after he had run his eye up and down the
line. “Joe and Arthur are so far away that
you can’t touch them.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Never mind,” replied Tom, in the same
cautious whisper. “They will have to come
closer together when we get to the stake-boat,
and then, perhaps, we can do something. Keep
your weather eye peeled for Noble. He’ll
spoil your chances if he can. He’s bound to
win or kick up a row.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Are you all ready?” shouted Mr. Hastings,
from his place on the wharf.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>There was no response in words, but each
boy grasped his double paddle with a firmer
hold, dipped one blade of it into the water
and leaned forward so that he could put all
his strength into the first stroke, which was
given before the notes of the bugle had fairly
died away.</p>

<p class='c019'>The thirteen contestants got off well together,
and for a while it was any body’s race; but
by the time a quarter of a mile had been
passed over, Arthur Hastings and Roy Sheldon,
who “made the pace”, began to draw to the
front, while others fell behind, and when they
rounded the stake-boat the line was very much
broken. Tom Bigden did not try to win.
According to the agreement this was not his
race. He simply kept close beside his cousin—he
had harder work to do it than he expected
to have, for Loren sent his canoe through the
water at an astonishing rate of speed—holding
himself in readiness to frustrate any attempt
at trickery on Frank Noble’s part, or to foul
Frank if he showed speed enough to beat Loren
fairly.</p>

<p class='c019'>How the struggle would have ended, had each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>boy been as determined to win or lose on his
merits as the majority of them were, it is hard
to tell. Arthur and Roy paddled much faster
now than they did on the day they had those
friendly trials with Tom and his cousin, and
so did Loren. Frank Noble, who was by no
means an antagonist to be despised, kept
close company with them, while Joe Wayring
seemed content to linger behind and save his
wind so that he could force the pace on the
way home; consequently he was an eye-witness
to a piece of deliberate rascality on the part of
Tom Bigden, which was so neatly executed
that it might have passed for an accident, if
Joe, when questioned by the judge, had not told
the truth concerning it. It came about in this
way:</p>

<p class='c019'>Arthur and Roy rounded the stake-boat
together, keeping far enough away from each
other to avoid all danger of a collision. Frank
Noble followed in their wake, and close behind
him came Loren Farnsworth, who having got
his “second wind”, was plying his paddle with
so much strength and skill that he was rapidly
closing up the gap between himself and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>leaders. Noble saw defeat staring him in the
face, and believing that he could gain a few
feet on Hastings and his companion, and throw
Loren out of the race at the same time, he
resorted to an expedient which drew a warning
shout from Joe Wayring, who was contentedly
following in Tom’s rear.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Look out there, Frank!” cried Joe.
“You’ll be foul of somebody in a minute
more.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I told Tom that Loren Farnsworth should
never come out at the top of the heap in this
race, and I meant every word of it,” said
Frank, to himself; and paying no attention to
Joe’s warning, he shot his canoe across Loren’s
bow, passing so close to him that the latter was
obliged to stop paddling and back water in
order to escape the collision which for a second
or two seemed inevitable.</p>

<p class='c019'>This was Tom Bigden’s opportunity and he
was prompt to improve it. With a movement
so quick and dextrous that it looked like an
accident to the people on shore who witnessed
it, Tom unjointed his paddle, dropped one blade
of it overboard, and laying out all his strength
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>on the other, he swung the bow of his canoe
around and sent it crashing into the side of
Noble’s boat, overturning it in an instant and
throwing its occupant out into the water.
Then, quick as a flash, Tom backed his canoe
out of Loren’s way and sent it directly in the
path of the other boys, who were thus given
their choice between two courses of action:
One was to make a wide detour in order to
clear the three boats that lay in their way, and
the other was to give up the race, which was
now virtually left to Hastings, Sheldon and
Loren Farnsworth. The most of them preferred
to draw out of a contest in which they had no
show of winning, and with many exclamations
of anger and disgust turned about and paddled
back to the starting point; while the others
crowded up around the stake-boat to hear
what the judge and referee would have to say
about it.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I claim foul on that!” shouted Tom; and
the words and the speaker’s easy assurance so
astonished Joe Wayring, that he sat in his
canoe with his paddle suspended in the air as
if he did not know what to do with it.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>“I claim foul!” sputtered Noble, as soon as
his head appeared above the surface of the
water. “Bigden capsized me on purpose.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I say I didn’t!” cried Tom, looking very
surprised and innocent indeed. “What business
had you to try to cross my bows, when
any body with half an eye could see that you
had no chance to do it? You declared that if
you didn’t win this race no one else should,
and that’s why you got in my way.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“And you said that your Cousin Loren was
booked to win, if you could make him do it,”
retorted Noble, who had climbed into his canoe
and was rapidly throwing out the water it had
shipped in righting. “That’s why you capsized
me. It is a lucky thing for you that you
didn’t smash in the side of my boat as you
tried to do. I would have made you pay
roundly for it, if there is law enough in Mount
Airy to—”</p>

<p class='c019'>“That will do,” said the judge, in a tone of
authority. “This is not the place to settle
quarrels, and neither am I the one to do
it.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“My paddle got unjointed, and I couldn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>shift from one side to the other quick enough
to keep clear of you,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c019'>Meanwhile Hastings, Sheldon and Loren
Farnsworth were making fast time down the
home stretch toward the starting point. To
the surprise of every body, and to the no small
annoyance of Arthur Hastings, who had never
before been so closely followed by any one except
Sheldon and Wayring, Loren was not only
holding his own, but he was gaining at every
stroke. There is no telling which one of the
three would have come out ahead at the finish,
had they been permitted to continue the struggle;
but the referee, seeing the commotion
among the rest of the fleet, called out: “No
race!” and pulled up to the stake-boat to see
what was the matter. The judge gave him his
version of the affair, Noble and Tom Bigden
gave theirs, and each of the two boys would
have expressed his opinion of the other in no
very complimentary terms, had not the referee
interrupted them by saying—</p>

<p class='c019'>“Hard words can’t settle disputes of this
kind. The race will have to be tried over again,
and Noble, I don’t think you will be allowed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>to take any part in it. You made a mistake in
trying to cross Bigden’s bows when you did,
because you had no room to do it without interfering
with him. You threw him out of the
contest, and came very near throwing Farnsworth
out, too; consequently it will be my
duty to bar you. I am sorry—”</p>

<p class='c019'>“You needn’t be, for I am sure I don’t care,”
replied Noble, rudely. He tried hard to control
himself so that the boys around him should
not see how very angry he was, but his efforts
met with little success. To be ruled out of one
contest was to be ruled out of all; and that was
a severe blow to a boy who had confidently
expected to carry off some of the best prizes.
“What are you going to do with Bigden?” he
asked, or rather demanded of the referee.</p>

<p class='c019'>“That depends,” answered the latter, somewhat
sharply.</p>

<p class='c019'>“He can’t do any thing with me because I
have violated no rule,” said Tom, defiantly.
“You ran across my path when you had no
business to do it, and an accident to my paddle
made me run into you. That’s all there is
of it.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>But the referee and judge seemed to hold a
different opinion. They conversed for a few
minutes in tones so low that no one but the
guides could hear what they said, and presently
the judge appealed to Joe Wayring.</p>

<p class='c019'>“You were close behind Bigden when this
happened,” said he. “Do you think it was an
accident?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“What does he know about it?” cried Tom,
fiercely. “I don’t care what he or anybody
else says; I know—”</p>

<p class='c019'>“One moment, please,” interrupted the referee.
“You have had your say, and you don’t
help your side of the case any by showing so
much excitement over it.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Do you think Bigden unjointed his paddle
purposely?” continued the judge, addressing
himself to Joe.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Yes, sir,” answered the latter, promptly.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Do you think he could have kept clear of
Noble if he had made use of ordinary skill and
caution?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I am sure of it.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“How could he have done it?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“By working his paddle on the port side of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>his canoe. That would have thrown him around
the stake-boat very neatly and given him a winning
place in the race; but instead of that he
used his paddle on the starboard side, and of
course that threw the bow of his canoe plump
into Noble’s side.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Frank and the judge nodded as if to say that
that was about the way the thing stood, and
after a few minutes’ reflection the referee said—</p>

<p class='c019'>“I am perfectly satisfied and will announce
my decision where all the members of the club
can hear it. As we are wasting time and delaying
the other sports by staying here, we will
go back to head-quarters.”</p>

<p class='c019'>It was not a very sociable company of boys
who turned about at this command and paddled
slowly back to the starting point, and
neither were Noble and Tom Bigden the only
ones among them who were mad enough to
fight. Two of their number were so jealous of
each other and so anxious to win prizes, that
they had deliberately disgraced the club in the
presence of hundreds of strangers; and it is
hard to see how any lover of fair play could
help being annoyed over it. Joe Wayring felt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>it very keenly; and consequently when Tom
Bigden paddled up alongside and told him that
he intended to get even with him some way for
the stand he had taken, Joe was in just the
right humor to give him as good as he sent.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Joe Wayring, you have made an enemy of
me by this day’s work,” said Tom, in a threatening
tone.</p>

<p class='c019'>“By telling the truth in regard to your fouling
of Frank Noble?” exclaimed Joe. “I
don’t care if I have. I saw the whole proceeding,
and I know that you meant to do it. I
warned you that any boy who could so far forget
himself as to deliberately interfere with
another, would be forever ruled out of the
club’s races, and you will find that I knew what
I was talking about.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“You might as well expel me and be done
with it?” exclaimed Tom, angrily. “What’s
the use of my belonging to the club if I am not
allowed to take part in its contests? Joe
Wayring, there’s no honor about you. You
have led me to believe that you were my
friend, and then you went back on me the
very first chance you got.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>“Do you mean that I have been sailing
under false colors?” cried Joe, indignantly.
“If you throw out any more insinuations of
that sort before we reach the boat-house I’ll
dump you in the lake. When the judge
questioned me I told him the truth; and I
wouldn’t have done otherwise to please any
body.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Something must have warned Tom that
Joe would be as good as his word, for he had
nothing more to say to him. He gradually
fell behind and allowed him to paddle down to
the boat-house in peace.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>
  <h2 class='c011'>CHAPTER XII. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>OFF FOR INDIAN LAKE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c018'>WHEN Joe Wayring beached his canoe
below the boat-house, he was immediately
surrounded by his friends who were
impatient to hear all about it. They knew
there had been a foul, for some of the laggards
in the race had seen it; but they could not tell
how it had been brought about, or who was to
blame for it.</p>

<p class='c019'>“It was Noble’s fault in the first place, and
Tom Bigden’s in the second,” said Joe, in
response to their hurried inquiries. “It seems
that there are three ‘cliques’ in the club, one
of which believes in doing things fairly, while
the other two do not. Loren Farnsworth was
‘booked’ by one of the cliques to win the paddle
race, while Frank Noble was the choice of the
other. Each was determined that his opponent
should not win, and the result was most disgraceful—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>deliberate collision at the stake-boat in
the presence of all these strangers. What sort
of a story will they carry back to the city about
the Mount Airy canoe club? Noble began the
row by putting himself in Loren’s way and
Tom retaliated by capsizing Frank’s canoe
and throwing him out into the water.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Do you think he meant to do it?” inquired
Hastings, who was far in the lead at the time,
and could not of course see what was going on
behind him.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I know he did,” replied Joe, who then
went on to give a circumstantial account of
the manner in which the fouling was done.
The boys all declared that it was a very neat
trick, and one of them added—</p>

<p class='c019'>“That Tom Bigden’s cheek is something
wonderful. As soon as he had backed out of
Loren’s way and laid himself across the course
so that we couldn’t get by him without losing
more ground than we could possibly make up,
he called out that he claimed foul on that.
Did you ever hear of such impudence?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Please give me your attention for one
moment, gentlemen,” shouted the president
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>of the club; and Joe and his friends turned
about to see the referee perched upon a dry-goods
box.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Young gentlemen,” said he, as the boys
gathered around him, “the contestants in the
paddle race will go over the course again this
afternoon, one hour after lunch. They will be
the same as before, with the exception of Frank
Noble and Thomas Bigden, whom I am compelled
to bar out. It is exceedingly unpleasant
to me to be obliged to render this decision,
but the rules under which your sports are
conducted leave me no alternative.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“What do you think of that, fellows?”
said Arthur Hastings. “If Bigden isn’t satisfied
now that he can’t run this club to suit his
own ideas, I shall always think he ought to be.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, Noble,” said Prime. “You’re done
for at last. You are ruled out of every thing.
What are you going to do?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“What are <i>you</i> going to do?” asked Frank
in reply.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I? Nothing at all. What can I do?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“You can go home with me, can’t you?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Eh? Well—yes; I suppose I could, but I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>don’t want to. The fun is only just beginning.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“And are you going to stay here and enjoy
yourself and assist in making the meet a success
when one of your friends is barred out?”
exclaimed Noble, indignantly. “I didn’t think
that of you, Prime. Why didn’t you stay
close to me so that you could put in a word to
help me? You knew what I was going to do.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I couldn’t stay close to you. Those fellows
in the lead made the pace so hot that I had to
fall behind, and I didn’t see the foul when it
occurred.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“No matter for that. You could have said
something in my defense if you had wanted to;
but instead of standing by me, you left me to
fight Joe Wayring and the judge alone. Look
there! Bigden’s cousins are not going back on
him as you are going back on me. Tom is preparing
to go home, and they are going with him.”</p>

<p class='c019'>But Noble did not know what a stormy time
Tom had with Loren and Ralph before he could
induce them to forego all the sports and pleasures
of the meet. Loren was particularly obstinate.
He was satisfied now that he was a pretty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>good hand with a double paddle, and confident
that if any of the three recognized champions
beat him when the afternoon race came off, they
would have to make their canoes get through
the water faster than they ever did before.
Then there was the upset race, which Ralph
was almost sure he could win, and the greasy
pole walk, with Miss Arden’s silk flag to go to
the best man—must they give up all these
things just because Tom had been ruled out?</p>

<p class='c019'>“What’s the reason I am ruled out?”
exclaimed Tom, who was as mad as a boy ever
gets to be. “Isn’t it because I tried my best
to help Loren win the paddle race? I tell you
that you don’t stand the least show of winning
any thing; but stay if you want to.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Ralph and Loren were well enough acquainted
with Tom to know that there was a volume of
meaning in his last words. If they braved his
anger they would be sure to suffer for it in the
end, and if Tom turned against them, where
could they look for friends and associates?
Prime and his followers would not have any
thing more to do with them; Joe Wayring,
unless he was as blind as a bat, had seen quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>enough to make him suspicious of them; and
when they came to look at it, they found that
they were in a very unenviable situation.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I’d give almost any thing if I could live the
last half hour over again,” declared Loren, after
he had taken a few minutes in which to consider
the matter. “We’ve made Noble and
his crowd so mad that they’ll never look at us
again, Tom is just as good as expelled from the
club, and we may as well give up all hope of
being admitted to the Toxophilites. We’re at
outs with every body, and the only thing we can
do is to stand by one another.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Ralph thought so, too. Without wasting any
more time in argument they put on their long
coats to cover up the uniforms they would
probably never wear again, shoved off their
canoes, and set out for home; and no one
except Frank Noble saw them go. The other
members of the club were too much interested
in their own affairs to pay any attention to the
movements of a boy who had gone deliberately
to work to mar their day’s enjoyment.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Tom’s got two fellows to stand by him, but
I am left alone,” thought Noble, with no little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>bitterness in his heart. “Prime and the rest
of them pretend to hate Wayring and his
crowd, and yet they are willing to stay and
help on the sports after I have been kicked out
of the lists. For two cents I’d hunt up Wayring
and tell him to look out for Scott and
Lord.”</p>

<p class='c019'>But he didn’t do it. He knew that such a
proceeding would turn every body against him,
and he had made enemies enough already.
Without attracting attention he got into his
canoe and paddled down to his boat-house.</p>

<p class='c019'>The unfortunate ending of the paddle race
had a most depressing effect upon the members
of the canoe club, some of whom declared that
their organization was on the eve of falling to
pieces. After that every thing “dragged”.
The whole programme was duly carried out,
but the contestants did not enter into the
sports with their usual spirit and energy. Scott
and Lord, who were “booked” for the sailing
and upset races, respectively, won nothing at all.
They could not win fairly, and the promptness
with which Tom and Frank had been ruled out
deterred them from attempting any tricks.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>Arthur Hastings won the paddle race after a
hard struggle; Joe Wayring, being the first to
walk the greasy pole, carried off Miss Arden’s
silk flag; and Roy for once went home as empty
handed as he came, the sailing and upset races
being won by other boys. But Roy wasn’t
mad about it, as some of the unsuccessful ones
were. He had come there for a “good time”,
and he had it; and his failure to win a prize
did not spoil his day’s sport.</p>

<p class='c019'>After the spectators had gone back to their
hotels and all the members of the club had set
out for home, the three chums sat down in the
boat-house to compare notes.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I am glad it’s over,” said Roy, giving
expression to the thoughts that were passing
through the minds of his companions. “It
was the meanest meet I ever heard of. I
wouldn’t have had that affair at the stake-boat
happen for any thing. Those visitors from
New London will say that we are as bad as the
professional oarsmen who saw their boats, and
capsize themselves on purpose.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, you expected something of the kind,
didn’t you?” said Joe. “I did. When Bigden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>told me that there were certain boys in the
club who had been ‘booked’ to win certain
races, I was sure that Prime had a finger in the
pie, and that the reason Tom told me about it
was because he had got mad at him or some
member of his party. The events of the day
have proved that I was right. In making up
the slate, Prime and his friends either forgot
or refused to give any of the races to Tom
and his cousins, and that was what caused the
trouble.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, it’s some satisfaction to know that
they will never have a chance to cause us any
more trouble,” said Arthur. “They will withdraw
from the club, of course.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I think there’s no doubt about that,” said
Joe. “I know that that is what I should do
if I were in their place. As Tom Bigden said:
‘What’s the use of belonging to a club if you
are not allowed to take part in the contests?’
I am of the opinion that they will band
together and get up a club of their own. Now
let’s talk about something else. To-morrow
we start for Indian Lake.”</p>

<p class='c019'>This was a much more agreeable topic of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>conversation than the canoe meet, and they
talked about it until the lengthening shadows
admonished Arthur and Roy that it was time
for them to set out for their homes.</p>

<p class='c019'>Indian Lake was a favorite place of resort
for the Mount Airy sportsmen, and for these
three boys in particular. They went there regularly
every summer. The country about the
village was not wild enough to suit them, and
besides the trout streams were so constantly
fished by the New London anglers, that they
were beginning to show signs of giving out.
Joe and his friends were so well acquainted
with the lake that they never thought of taking
a guide when they went there for recreation.
They went everywhere that a guide could take
them, and with no fear of being lost. They
were joint partners in a skiff, which they had
fitted up with special reference to these annual
trips—a strong, easy running craft, so light
that it could be carried over the portages without
any great outlay of strength, and so roomy
that the boys could sleep in it without being
crowded. It was provided with lockers fore
and aft, in which the owners carried their extra
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>clothing, provisions and camp equipage, an
awning to keep off the sun and a water-proof
tent which would keep them dry, no matter
how hard the rain came down. With this boat
a journey of a hundred miles—that was the distance
between Mount Airy and Indian Lake,
and there was a navigable water-course almost
all the way—was looked upon as a pleasure
trip. The boys would have been astonished if
they had known what was to be the result of
this particular visit to the lake.</p>

<p class='c019'>That night there were three busy young fellows
in Mount Airy, who were packing up and
getting ready for an early start on the following
morning. If you could have seen their
things after they got them together, you might
have been surprised to see that there was not
a single fowling-piece among them. What
was the use of taking guns into the woods
during the “close” season—that is, while the
game was protected by law? But each boy
took with him a weapon which, in his hands,
was almost as deadly as a shot gun is in the
hands of an ordinary marksman—a long bow
with its accompanying quiver full of arrows.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>The law permitted them to shoot loons—if they
could. At any rate it was sport to try, and to
see the lightning-like movements of the bird
as it went under water at the twang of the bow-string.</p>

<p class='c019'>“There’s one thing about your outfit that
doesn’t look just right,” said Uncle Joe, pointing
to the heavy bait-rod which his nephew
placed in the corner beside his long bow.
“The idea of catching trout with a thing like
that, and worms for bait! Before you go into
the woods again I will see that you have a nice
light fly-rod.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“But I can’t throw a fly,” said Joe.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, you can learn, can’t you?”</p>

<p class='c019'>Joe said he thought he could, and there the
matter rested for a whole year.</p>

<p class='c019'>The next morning at four o’clock Joe Wayring
was sitting on the wharf in front of the
boat-house, watching Arthur Hastings, who was
coming up the lake in the skiff. When he
arrived Joe passed down to him two cases, one
containing his long bow and quiver, the other
his bait-rod and dip-net, a bundle of blankets,
a soldier’s knapsack with a change of clothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>in it, and the contents of a big market basket.
The basket itself was left on the wharf, because
it would have taken up too much valuable
space in the lockers. Mars, the Newfoundlander,
begged to go, too, and growled spitefully
at Arthur’s little cocker spaniel, which growled
defiantly back at him from his safe perch on
the stern locker. Jim (that was the spaniel’s
name), always went on these expeditions as
body-guard and sentinel. He seemed to have a
deep sense of the responsibility that rested
upon him, and the arrogant and overbearing
manner in which he conducted himself toward
strangers, proved that he considered himself to
be of some consequence in the world. He was
a featherweight and took up but little room;
while the Newfoundlander’s huge bulk would
have been sadly in their way. They might as
well have added another boy to the party.</p>

<p class='c019'>Having stowed his supplies and equipments
away in the lockers, Joe picked up an oar and
assisted Arthur to pull the skiff up to Mr.
Sheldon’s boat-house, where they found Roy
waiting for them. He soon transferred himself
and his belongings from the wharf to the cock-pit,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>and then the skiff went at a rapid rate
across the lake toward the river, the boys
chanting a boat song as they steadily plied the
oars. They paused a moment at the head of
the rapids, and as they gazed at them, Arthur
said—</p>

<p class='c019'>“How do you suppose Matt Coyle ever succeeded
in getting that big heavy punt of his
down there? I wouldn’t make the passage in
her for all the money there is in Mount Airy.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“It’s a wonder to me that he didn’t smash
her all to pieces,” said Joe. “She’s in Sherwin’s
Pond now, I suppose, and there she will
have to stay, for there is no way to get her out.
I wonder what Matt has done with my canoe?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh, he has snagged and sunk her before
this time,” replied Roy, consolingly. “I
wonder what he has done with the rod he stole
from me?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Some black bass has smashed it for him
most likely,” said Arthur. “At any rate you
will never handle it again.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The boys had from the first given up all hope of
ever recovering their lost property. The deputy
sheriff and constable, stimulated to extra exertion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>by the offer of a large reward by the
Mount Airy authorities, had scoured the woods
in every direction in search of the thief, but
their efforts had met with no success. They
found the site of Matt’s shanty, as we have said,
but the shanty itself had disappeared. So had
Matt and his family, and the officers could not
get upon their trail. Perhaps if we go back
to the day on which Matt stole Joe Wayring’s
canoe and follow his fortunes for a short time,
we shall see what the reason was.</p>

<p class='c019'>When the squatter picked up Joe’s double
paddle and shoved away from the shore, after
taking possession of all the fishing rods and
bundles that he could lay his hand on, he told
himself that he had done something toward
paying off the Mount Airy people for the
shameful manner in which they had treated
him and his family.</p>

<p class='c019'>“They wouldn’t let us stay up there to the
village an’ earn an honest livin’, like we wanted
to do,” said Matt, with a chuckle, “an’ now
I’ll show ’em how much they made by it. Them
things must be wuth a power of money,” he
went on, looking down at the elegant rods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>which he had unjointed and laid on the bottom
of the canoe, “an’ I reckon mebbe we’ve got
grub enough to last us fur a day or two—good
grub, too, sich as don’t often come into our
house less’n we hooks it. This is a powerful
nice little boat, this canoe is, an’ now we’ll go
up to Injun Lake, an’ me an’ the boys will set
up fur independent guides. If they won’t
have us there, we’ll bust up the business.”</p>

<p class='c019'>While communing thus with himself the
squatter did not neglect to ply his paddle vigorously,
nor to look over his shoulder now and
then to satisfy himself that his rascality had
not yet been discovered. But Joe and his companions
spent fully half an hour in roaming
about through the woods, looking for the bear
and shooting squirrels for their dinner, and
when they came out, Matt was nowhere in
sight. He had crossed the pond, and was urging
the canoe up a narrow winding creek
toward his habitation. With a caution which
had become a part of his nature, he had concealed
his place of abode so effectually that a
fleet of canoeists might have passed up the creek
without knowing that there was a shanty within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>less than a stone’s throw of them. The only
visible sign that any body had ever been in the
creek was a disreputable looking punt, with a
stove and battered bow, which was drawn out
upon the bank. She had had a hard time of
it in getting through the rapids, and it was a
mystery how Matt had saved himself from a
capsize, and kept his miserable old craft afloat
until he could get her up the creek. She had
carried the squatter and all his worldly possessions
for many a long mile on Indian Lake and
its tributary streams, but her days of usefulness
were over now. Her trip down the rapids
was the last she ever made. She was in Sherwin’s
Pond and there she must stay.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Hi, there!” yelled Matt, as he ran the bow
of the canvas canoe upon the bank.</p>

<p class='c019'>An answering yelp came from the bushes, and
presently Matt’s wife and boys came hurrying
out. They would not have expressed the least
surprise if the squatter had come back with as
many turkeys or chickens as he could conveniently
carry, because they were accustomed
to such things; but to see him in possession of
a nice little canoe, five silver mounted fishing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>rods and as many big bundles, excited their
astonishment.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Where did you get ’em, old man, an’ what’s
into them there bundles?” was the woman’s
whispered inquiry.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I got ’em up there in the pond clost to the
foot of the rapids,” answered Matt, gleefully.
“I’ll learn them rich fellers up to Mount Airy
to treat a gentleman right the next time they
see one. We’re jest as good as they be if we
are poor.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Course we be,” said Jake, Matt’s oldest
boy. “What’s them there things—fish poles?
I want one of ’em.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“All right. You an’ Sam take your pick,
an’ we’ll sell the rest. If you see a feller that
is needin’ a pole, you can tell him that you
know where he can get one worth the
money.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“About how much?” queried Jake.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Wal,” said Matt, reflectively, “them poles
must have cost nigh onto five dollars; but
seein’ that they’re second hand we will have
to take a leetle less fur ’em—say two an’ a
half.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>“An’ how much be them there things with
the cranks onto ’em wuth?” asked Sam.</p>

<p class='c019'>“’Bout the same. You tell the feller, when
you find him, that he can have a pole an’ a
windlass fur five dollars.”</p>

<p class='c019'>This showed how much the squatter knew
about some things. There wasn’t a rod in the
lot that cost less than twenty dollars, or a reel
that was worth less than thirteen. Matt would
have thought himself rich if he had known the
real value of the property he had in his possession.</p>

<p class='c019'>“What’s into them there bundles?” demanded
the old woman.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Grub,” answered Matt. “Good grub, too.”</p>

<p class='c019'>In less time than it takes to tell it, the bundles
had been jerked out of the canoe and
torn open. Matt’s family was always hungry,
and his wife and boys fairly gloated over the
hard boiled eggs, bacon, sardines, sandwiches
and other nice things which the boys’ thoughtful
mothers had put up for their dinner.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Rich folks has nice grub to eat, don’t
they?” said Jake, speaking as plainly as a
mouthful of bread and meat would permit.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>“Yes; an’ we’ll soon be in a fix to have
nice things, too,” said Matt, confidently.
“I’ve got a boat of my own now, an’ I’m goin’
to Injun Lake an’ set myself up fur a
guide.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“But, pap, they drove us away from there
once,” exclaimed Jake. “They was jest like
the Mount Airy folks—they didn’t want us
around.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Don’t I know it?” cried Matt, laying
down his sandwich long enough to shake both
his fists in the air. “But they won’t drive us
away again, I bet you, ’cause it’ll be wuss for
’em if they try it. I’ll kick up sich a rumpus
in them woods that every body will steer cl’ar
of ’em; then what’ll become of them big hotels
when they ain’t got no custom to support ’em?
I reckon we’d best be gettin’ away from here
this very night. I’m in a hurry to get to
guidin’ so’t I can make some money before the
season’s over, an’ besides I kinder want to get
outen the way of that there constable. He’ll
be along directly, lookin’ fur these things, an’
I don’t care to see him.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“What’ll we do with the house?” asked the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>old woman. “We can’t tote it cl’ar to the
lake on our backs.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Course not. We’ll burn it an’ the punt, too.
They won’t never be of no more use, ’cause
’taint no ways likely that we shall ever come here
agin’, an’ we ain’t goin’ to leave ’em fur them
Mount Airy fellers to use when they come to the
pond huntin’ an’ fishin’.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The squatter need not have borrowed trouble
on this score. There was not a hunter or a fisherman
in the village who could have been induced
to occupy his shanty or use his punt, for, like
their owners, they were things to be avoided.
But Matt and his family seemed to think that
they would be accommodating somebody if they
left them there, and the order to destroy them
by fire was carried out as soon as they had
eaten the last of the stolen provisions.</p>

<p class='c019'>While his wife was engaged in removing the
bedding and cooking utensils, and tying them
in small bundles so that they could be easily
carried, and the boys were at work hauling
the punt out of the water and turning it up
against the house so that the two would burn
together, Matt busied himself in putting the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>rods into their cases; after which he walked
around the canvas canoe and gave it a good
looking over. Tom Bigden had told him that
if he didn’t want to carry the canoe on his
back, he could take it to pieces and carry it in
his hand as he would a gripsack; but the
trouble was, Matt did not know how to go to
work to take it apart. Every thing fitted
snugly, and he could not find any place to begin.
The only parts of it that he could move were
the bottom boards; and when he had taken
them out, the frame-work of the canoe was as
solid as ever. He spent a quarter of a hour in
unavailing efforts to start something, and then
giving it up as a task beyond his powers, he
decided that the only thing he could do was to
carry it as he would carry any other canoe. A
less experienced man would have shrunk from
the undertaking. It was fully twenty miles to
the river which connected the two lakes, and
the course lay through a dense forest where
there was not even the semblance of a path.
But there was no other way to get the canoe to
Indian Lake.</p>

<p class='c019'>Meanwhile, Matt’s wife and boys had worked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>to such good purpose that every thing was
ready for the start. Each one had a bundle to
carry, and the boys had set fire to a quantity of
light wood which they had piled in the middle
of the shanty. They lingered long enough to
see the fire fairly started, and then turned
their faces hopefully toward Indian Lake, the
old woman leading the way, and Matt bringing
up the rear with the canvas canoe on his back.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c018'>HAVING plenty of time at their disposal,
Joe Wayring and his friends were in no
particular hurry to reach Indian Lake. After
they entered the river they kept the skiff moving
rapidly, but at the same time they did not
neglect to keep their eyes open for “rovers”—that
is, any objects, animate or inanimate,
that would give them an opportunity to try
their skill with their long bows. If a thieving
crow, a murderous blue jay, or a piratical kingfisher
showed himself within range, the sharp
hiss of an arrow admonished him that there
were enemies close at hand. Kingfishers were
objects of especial dislike. The boys were fish
culturists in a small way, and had stocked a
pond on Mr. Sheldon’s grounds. On the very
day that the “fry” were put into it, the kingfishers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>and minks made their appearance, and
then began a contest which had been kept up
ever since. By the aid of traps and breech-loaders
the boys waged an incessant warfare
upon the interlopers, and finally succeeded in
thinning them out so that the trout were
allowed to rest in comparative peace.</p>

<p class='c019'>The boys did not stop at noon, but ate their
lunch as they floated along with the current.
The monotony of the afternoon’s run was
broken by an hour’s chase after an eagle, which
they did not succeed in shooting, although one
of Roy’s arrows ruffled the feathers on his back,
and by a long search for an otter which swam
across the river in advance of them. About
four o’clock in the afternoon they reached a
favorite camping, or rather, anchoring ground,
a deep pool noted for its fine yellow perch,
and there they decided to stop for the night.
The anchor was dropped overboard just above
the pool, and when the skiff swung to the current,
the bait-rods they had purchased to
replace those that Matt Coyle had stolen from
them, were taken out of the lockers, floats
were rigged, a box of worms which they had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>been thoughtful enough to bring with them
was opened, and the sport commenced.</p>

<p class='c019'>The fish in that pool were always hungry, and
the floats disappeared as fast as they were
dropped into the water. A few “fingerlings”
were put back to be caught again after they
had had time to grow larger, but the most of
those they captured were fine fellows, and
heavy enough to make a stubborn resistance.
In less than half an hour they had taken all
they wanted for supper, and then the anchor
was pulled up and the skiff drawn alongside the
bank. Roy and Joe went ashore to clean the
fish, and Arthur staid in the boat to put up
the tent. This done, he brought out a pocket
cooking stove which he placed on the forward
locker, and by the time the fish were ready,
he had an omelet browning in the frying pan.
That, together with an ample supply of fried
perch, bread and butter and a cup of weak tea,
made up a supper to which they did full justice.</p>

<p class='c019'>There were still a few hours of daylight left,
and as soon as the dishes had been washed and
packed away in the locker, the boys took their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>bows and went ashore to stretch their legs and
shoot at “rovers”. Arthur succeeded in
bringing down a kingfisher after half an
hour’s hard stalking, and his companions shot
a squirrel apiece for breakfast. Just at dusk
they met at the boat, which was hauled out into
the stream and anchored. The jack-lamp was
lighted and hung upon one of the poles that
supported the tent, the rubber mattress was
inflated, and the three friends lounged around
and talked until they began to grow sleepy.
Then the blankets and pillows were brought to
light, one side of the tent was buttoned down
to the gunwale, the other being left up to
admit the air, and the boys laid down to sleep,
trusting to Jim to give them notice of the
approach of danger. He gave them notice
before three hours had passed away.</p>

<p class='c019'>About midnight the spaniel, which for half
an hour or more had been very restless, suddenly
jumped to his feet and set up a frightful
yelping. If some one had been pounding
him he could not have been in greater distress.
The boys started up in alarm to find the sky
overcast with black clouds, the wind coming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>down the river in strong and fitful gusts and
the anchor dragging. There was a storm coming
up, it promised to be a severe one, too, but
it did not find the young voyagers unprepared
to meet it. The forward end of the tent was
promptly rolled up, a spare anchor dropped
into the water, and the skiff was again brought
to a stand-still. By that time the rain was
falling in sheets, but the boys paid no sort of
attention to it. They buttoned the tent down
all around and went to sleep again, fully satisfied
with the precautions they had taken. Jim
was satisfied too, although he thought it necessary
to slumber lightly. Whenever a strong
gust of wind came roaring down the river, he
would turn his head on one side and look critically
at the anchor ropes, which led through
ring-bolts in the bow, and were made fast to
cleats on the forward locker; and having made
sure that the ground tackle was doing its full
duty, he would go to sleep again.</p>

<p class='c019'>The night passed without further incident,
the morning dawned clear and bright, and
after a breakfast of fried perch and broiled
squirrel, the boys resumed their journey toward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>Indian Lake. On the evening of the fifth day
after leaving Mount Airy, they found themselves
within a short distance of their destination;
but instead of going on to the lake they
turned into a creek which connected the river
with a lonely pond that lay deep in the forest.
They did not intend to go to Indian Lake until
they stood in need of supplies. There were
big hotels and a crowd of guests there, and
they saw enough of them at home. To quote
from Joe Wayring, their object was to get
away from every body and be lazy.</p>

<p class='c019'>The sun went down long before they turned
into the creek, and night was coming on; but
they pushed ahead in order to reach a favorite
anchorage in the mouth of a little brook, whose
waters could be relied on to furnish them with
a breakfast of trout. They laid out all their
strength on the oars and the skiff flew swiftly
and noiselessly up the stream, its movements
being governed by Arthur Hastings, who
looked over his shoulder now and then to take
his bearings. After they had been speeding
along for half an hour, he began keeping a
sharp lookout for the brook; and once when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>he turned around he thought he saw a moving
object in the creek a short distance away. He
looked again, and a thrill of exultation and
excitement ran all through him.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Joe,” said he, in a scarcely audible
whisper, “there’s your canvas canoe, as sure as
I’m a foot high.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Where?” exclaimed Joe and Roy, turning
quickly about on their seats.</p>

<p class='c019'>In reply Arthur pointed silently up the
creek. His companions looked, and then they
too became excited. There was a canoe in
advance of them sure enough, and dark as it
was, they instantly recognized it as the one
Matt Coyle had stolen from Joe Wayring.</p>

<p class='c019'>There was somebody in it, and he was plying
his double paddle as if he were in a great hurry.
He did not appear to know that there was any
one besides himself in the creek, for he never
once looked behind him.</p>

<p class='c019'>“It isn’t big enough for Matt, and so it must
be one of his boys,” whispered Roy.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Boy or man, he shall not go much further
with that canoe.” said Joe in a resolute tone.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>“That’s my boat and I’m going to have it, if
you fellows will stand by me.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Now Joe!” exclaimed Roy, reproachfully.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I didn’t mean that. Of course I know
that you can be depended on,” said Joe, hastily.
“Let’s take after him. If we find that
we can’t take the canoe away from him, we’ll
sink her. Matt Coyle shan’t have her any
longer.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The three oars fell into the water simultaneously,
and the skiff shot silently up the creek
in pursuit of the canoe, whose occupant was
making his double paddle whirl through the air
like the shafts of a windmill. An oar rattled
behind him and aroused him from his reverie.
He faced about to see the skiff close upon him.
The night had grown so dark that he could not
tell who the crew were, but he knew that they
would not come at him in that fashion unless
they had some object in view. Matt and his boys
always had the fear of the law before their eyes,
and Jake, believing that a constable or deputy
sheriff was in pursuit of him, turned about and
churned the water into foam in his desperate
attempt to outrun the skiff. He succeeded in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>getting a good deal of speed out of his clumsy
craft, but fast as he went the pursuers gained
at every stroke.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Hold on with that boat!” shouted Arthur.
“We’ve got you and you might as well give
in.”</p>

<p class='c019'>But Jake wasn’t that sort. He redoubled
his exertions with the paddle, but all of a sudden
his progress was stopped so quickly that
Jake left his seat and pitched headlong into
the bow of the canoe. Speaking in western
parlance he had “picked up a snag” whose
sharp, gnarled end penetrated the canvas covering
of the canoe, tearing a hole in it that was
as big as Jake’s head. It did not hang there
but floated off with the current, and began filling
rapidly. In a few seconds she was out of
sight, and Jake was making all haste to reach
the shore. A moment later the skiff dashed
up, and Roy Sheldon struck a vicious blow at
the swimmer with his oar; but he was just out
of reach. A few long strokes brought him to
shallow water, two jumps took him to dry land,
and in an instant more he was out of sight in
the bushes.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>“What tumbled him out so suddenly?”
exclaimed Joe.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Look out, boys! There’s a snag right under
us,” said Roy.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Where in the world is the boat?” inquired
Arthur.</p>

<p class='c019'>“There she is,” answered Joe, pointing to a
swirl in the water which marked the spot where
the canvas canoe was quietly settling down on
the bottom of the creek.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Sunk!” cried Roy. “So she is. She must
have a cargo of some sort aboard, or she would
not have gone down like that. Now, what’s to
be done?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“We can’t do any thing to-night,” replied
Joe. “I propose that we anchor here and wait
until morning comes to show us how she lies.
If the water isn’t over thirty feet deep we can
raise her.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The others agreeing to this proposition, the
ground tackle was got overboard, and Roy, who
handled the rope, encouraged Joe by assuring
him that the water was not an inch over twelve
feet deep.</p>

<p class='c019'>“If that is the case,” said the latter, hopefully,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>“I shall soon have my boat back again.
It will be no trouble at all to take a line down
twelve feet. I’d give something to know what
she is loaded with.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Contraband goods, I’ll be bound,” said
Arthur. “The fruits of a raid on somebody’s
smoke-house or hen-roost. I am sorry to know
that Matt Coyle is in the neighborhood, for we
don’t know at what moment he may jump down
on us and steal something.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“We mustn’t let him catch us off our guard,”
said Roy. “It won’t be safe to leave the skiff
alone for a minute.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The boys’ hands were as busy as their
tongues, and in a short time the tent was up, a
light from the jack-lamp was streaming out
over the water, and the appetizing odor of fried
bacon filled the air. The knowledge that the
thieving squatter was no great distance away,
and that he might make his appearance at any
moment, did not cause them to eat lighter suppers
than usual, nor did it interfere with their
customary sound and refreshing sleep. They
felt safe from attack. They did not believe
that Matt Coyle had a boat (they knew very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>well that he could not have brought the punt
with him), and consequently there was no way
for him to reach them unless he resorted to
swimming; and they did not think he would
be foolish enough to try that.</p>

<p class='c019'>The boys slept soundly that night, but the
next morning’s sun found them astir. Arthur
made a cup of coffee over the pocket cooking
stove, after which the tent was taken down, and
Joe Wayring made ready for business by
divesting himself of his clothing.</p>

<p class='c019'>The first thing was to find out just where the
canoe lay, and that did not take them as long
as they thought it would. The water was as
clear as crystal, and every thing on the bottom
could be plainly seen by Joe and Roy, who
leaned as far as they could over opposite sides
of the skiff, while Arthur rowed them back and
forth in the vicinity of the snag.</p>

<p class='c019'>“There she is!” cried Roy, suddenly; and
as he spoke he caught up the anchor and dropped
it overboard. “We’re right over her, and
there isn’t a snag or any other obstruction in
the way.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Joe Wayring stepped upon the forward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>locker, holding in his hand one end of a rope
which he had coiled down on the bottom of the
skiff so that it would run out easily, and as
soon as the boat stopped swinging he dived out
of sight. When the commotion in the water
occasioned by his descent had ceased, his companions
could observe every move he made as
he scrambled about over the sunken canoe, and
presently they saw him coming up.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Haul away,” said Joe, as he shook the
water from his face and climbed back into the
skiff.</p>

<p class='c019'>“What’s it fast to?” asked Roy.</p>

<p class='c019'>“A bag of potatoes.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“What did I tell you?” exclaimed Arthur
Hastings. “I knew that fellow had been on a
plundering expedition.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“But you thought he had been robbing
somebody’s hen-roost or smoke-house,” Roy
reminded him.</p>

<p class='c019'>“And so he has,” said Joe. “There’s a
whole side of bacon down there.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The boys pulled gently on the line, and
presently the bag of potatoes came to the surface.
It was seized and hauled into the skiff,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>the line was unfastened and passed over to Joe,
who was about to go down again, when his
movements were arrested by the snapping of
twigs and the sound of voices which came from
the depths of the woods. They were angry
voices, too, and rendered somewhat indistinct
by distance and intervening bushes, but the
boys recognized them at once.</p>

<p class='c019'>“There comes Matt Coyle, his wife and both
their boys,” said Joe. “Now we shall hear
something.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I wonder what they think they are going to
do,” said Roy. “Just listen to the noise they
make in crashing through the brush. One
would think there were a lot of wild cattle in
there.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Joe Wayring did not await their appearance,
but went down to reeve the line through a
ring-bolt in the stern-post of the sunken canoe,
and to bring up her painter and the side of
bacon. When he arose to the surface Matt
Coyle and his family were striding up and
down the bank, shaking their fists and swearing
lustily.</p>

<p class='c019'>“That there is my hog-meat, too,” roared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>the squatter, as Joe tossed the bacon into the
skiff. “I want it an’ I’m goin’ to have it, I
tell you.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“We don’t know that these provisions
rightfully belong to you,” said Roy. “We
have an idea that you stole them last night
or, rather,—”</p>

<p class='c019'>“No, I didn’t steel ’em nuther,” shouted
Matt.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Or, rather, that one of your boys did,”
continued Roy, while Joe hung on to the side
of the skiff and looked over it at the angry
party on the shore. “I am sure we don’t
want them.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Then bring ’em ashore like we told you,”
screamed the old woman. “You’re thieves
yourselves if you keep ’em.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Do you see any thing green about us?”
demanded Arthur. “I’ll tell you what we
will do: If you will stay there on the bank in
plain sight until we get our boat raised, we
will go up the creek and leave the potatoes and
bacon opposite the mouth of the trout brook, so
that you can get them after we have gone away.
What are you going to do with those sticks?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>he added, addressing himself to the two boys
who just then came out of the bushes with a
heavy club in each hand.</p>

<p class='c019'>“We’re goin’ to knock you out o’ that
boat if you don’t fetch that there grub of our’n
ashore without no more foolin’,” answered
Jake, in threatening tones. “It’s our’n an’
we’re goin’ to have it back.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“That’s the idee, Jakey,” exclaimed the
old woman, approvingly. “Knock the young
’ristocrats out o’ their boat. I reckon that’ll
bring ’em to time.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“If you try that, I’ll lay some of you out
flatter than so many pancakes,” returned Roy,
defiantly; and as he spoke he tore open the
bag containing the potatoes. Catching up one
in each hand, his example being promptly
followed by Arthur Hastings, he arose to his
feet just in time to dodge one of Jake’s clubs,
which came whirling through the air straight
for his head. Before the missile had struck
the water on the other side of the skiff, Roy
launched one of his potatoes at the aggressor.
Like most left-handed fellows Roy could throw
like lightning; and the potato, flying true to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>its aim and with terrific force, struck Jake
fairly in the pit of the stomach, and doubled
him up like a jack-knife.</p>

<p class='c019'>“That’s the idee, Jakey,” yelled Joe Wayring,
who was delighted with the accuracy of
his chum’s shot. “Knock them young ’ristocrats
out o’ their boat. I reckon that’ll bring
’em to time. Throw another, Jakey.”</p>

<p class='c019'>But Jake was in no condition to throw
another. It was a long time before he could get
his breath; and when he did get it, the howls
with which he awoke the echoes of the surrounding
woods were wonderful to hear. The squatter’s
family, believing that Jake had been mortally
wounded, gathered about him with expressions
of sympathy, and Joe Wayring took advantage
of the confusion to climb into the skiff
and put on his clothes. If there was
going to be a fight he wanted to take a hand in
it.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Whoop!” shrieked the old woman, rolling
up her sleeves and shaking a pair of huge, tan-colored
fists at the object of her wrath. “If I
was a man I’d swim off to that there boat an’
maul the last one of you. Matt, why don’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>you do it? Seems like you was afeard of them
fellers.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Yes, Matt, why don’t you do it?” said
Arthur, encouragingly.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Yes, Matt, show a little pluck,” chimed in
Roy. “Come on. Swim off to us; and if I
don’t sink you before you have got ten feet
from the shore, I’m a Dutchman.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I don’t think we have any thing more to
fear from them,” said Joe, in a low tone.
“It’s a lucky thing for us that Roy thought of
using those potatoes. If we had nothing to
defend ourselves with they could drive us
away from here very easily. Now let’s raise
the canoe, and go up to the brook and catch
our breakfast. I’m getting hungry.”</p>

<p class='c019'>It was scarcely two minutes’ work to bring
the wreck to the surface. It readily yielded to
the strain that Joe and Arthur brought to bear
upon the lines, and as soon as they could get
hold of it, they drew it into the skiff stern
foremost, thus compelling the water with which
it was filled to run out at the hole in the bow.
After that it was turned bottom upward over
the stern locker and lashed fast. Of course
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>Matt Coyle and his family had not been silent
all this while. They had kept up a constant
storm of threats and abuse, and the squatter
fairly danced with rage when he saw the boat,
with which he had expected to accomplish so
much in the way of “independent guidin’” was
lost to him forever. But they did not attempt
any more violence, for Roy stood guard over his
companions with a potato in each hand, and
ready to open fire on them at any moment.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Now, then!” exclaimed Joe, as he pulled
up the anchor while the other boys shipped
their oars, “do you want these provisions, or
don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Course I want ’em,” growled Matt, in
reply. “They’re mine, an’ we ain’t got no
grub to eat.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“All right. I don’t suppose that you have
the shadow of a right to them, but we will give
them up to you if you will do as we say.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Wal, I won’t do as you say, nuther,”
declared Matt. “I ain’t goin’ to let myself be
bossed around by no ’ristocrats, I bet you.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Then you shan’t have the potatoes,” said
Joe, decidedly. “Give way, boys.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>“Say! Hold on, there,” exclaimed Matt,
whose larder was empty and had been for some
time. “What do you want me to do?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“We want you to stay right there on the
bank until we can go up and land your provisions
on the point opposite the mouth of the
brook,” replied Joe. “You must keep out in
plain sight, mind you, for if you go back into
the woods we shall think you are up to something,
and then you can whistle for your
grub.”</p>

<p class='c019'>As Joe said this he shipped an oar, and the
skiff moved up the creek toward the point.
The boys kept a close watch over Matt Coyle,
but he never left the bank. He was biding his
time, so he told his wife and boys. Joe and
his friends had the advantage of him now, but
there might come a day when he could catch
them off their guard, and then they had better
look out. If he couldn’t take vengeance on them
this summer, he would do it next summer.
He would follow them wherever they went;
and if he couldn’t get a chance to steal
every thing they had, he would make the
country about Indian Lake so warm for them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>that they would be glad to go somewhere else
to spend their vacations.</p>

<p class='c019'>As Matt remained on the bank in plain sight
and did not attempt to approach them under
cover of the bushes, the boys landed the provisions,
according to promise—that is, they put
some of them on the point; but Roy was sharp
enough to keep out about half a peck of the
potatoes to be used in case of emergency. This
being done, they pulled across the creek into
the mouth of the brook to catch a mess of
trout, which they decided to cook over a fire on
the bank. The breeze was so strong that the
lamp in their little stove would not burn in the
open air, and they knew that if they put up
their tent, Matt and his boys would have the
advantage if they opened a fire of clubs upon
them when they came after their potatoes and
bacon.</p>

<p class='c019'>It was well that they took these precautions,
for when the squatter appeared on
the opposite bank he was fierce for a fight. He
and his backers were all armed with clubs, one
of which was sent sailing through the air
toward the skiff. Jim was sitting on one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>the lockers, impatiently waiting to be called to
breakfast, and the club, after glancing from the
side of the boat, struck him in the ribs and
tumbled him off into the creek.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>
  <h2 class='c011'>CHAPTER XIV. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>THE HISTORIAN CONCLUDES HIS NARRATIVE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c018'>“WHOOP-EE!” yelled Matt Coyle, dancing
about on the bank in high glee.
“That was a good shot. Lookout! Here comes
another that’s goin’ to send some of you to
keep company with the purp. I reckon we’ve
got you whar we want you this time, cause
the taters is all on our side the creek.”</p>

<p class='c019'>As the squatter spoke a second club left his
hand, being thrown with so much force and
accuracy that if the boys had not been on the
alert, some and perhaps all of them would have
been knocked overboard, for the missile was
almost as long as the cock-pit, and as it came
through the air with a rotary motion, it covered
space enough to hit all their heads at
once. This was the signal for a perfect shower
of clubs. Every one of the family had two or
more, which were thrown as rapidly as they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>could be changed from one hand to the other, and
Joe and his chums were kept so busy dodging
them, that they could not find opportunity to
return the fire. But when the squatter and
his allies had thrown all their clubs without
effect, and thus disarmed themselves, the boys
sprang to their feet and opened their battery.
The first potato Roy threw took Jake square
in the mouth, bringing forth another series
of doleful yells from that unlucky young
ruffian, and the second put the old woman’s
right arm in a sling for a week. At the same
moment Arthur wiped out the insult that had
been put upon Jim by taking Matt a whack
under the eye that raised a lump as large as a
hen’s egg.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Whoop-ee!” shouted Joe Wayring, as a
potato from his own hand struck Sam’s tattered
cap from his head. “That was a bully shot.
Look out! Here comes another. We ain’t
got no taters on this side of the creek, I
reckon.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The fusillade that followed was a hot one, and
the squatter and his family, finding that they
could not stand against it, beat a hasty retreat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>into the bushes. Then Arthur turned to assist
Jim, who had been making desperate but
unavailing efforts to climb into the skiff. He
wasn’t hurt at all, but he was very mad.</p>

<p class='c019'>The plucky boys were not called upon to
defend themselves. Matt Coyle made an
attempt to secure the provisions, but went back
with an aching head and a bloody nose, and
the three chums saw no more of him that summer.
But they heard him. From his place of
concealment in the bushes the squatter and his
wife abused them roundly, and shouted at them
threats that were enough to frighten almost
any body.</p>

<p class='c019'>The boys caught a fine string of trout, cooked
and ate breakfast in peace, and then kept on
up the creek toward the pond. As soon as
they were out of range, Matt and his family
came from their hiding-places after the potatoes
and bacon; but they made no demonstration
beyond showing the boys their fists and swearing
at them.</p>

<p class='c019'>After that things went smoothly with Joe
and his companions. They thoroughly enjoyed
their outing, and when it was ended they went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>home with a new lease of life, and with brains
invigorated to such degrees that they were
ready to grapple with any thing that might
come before them during the school term, which
was to begin on the following Monday.</p>

<p class='c019'>During the year affairs in Mount Airy moved
along in much the same way that they do in
every little village which can boast of a popular
high school and rival organizations of
almost every kind. After the canoe meet, the
line was sharply drawn between the two
opposing factions. They did not come to
open warfare, but they were intensely hostile,
and a very little thing would have precipitated
a fight between Joe Wayring and his friends
on one side, and Noble, Scott, Prime and Tom
Bigden and his cousins on the other; for the
latter did not long remain at swords’ points
with the boys who made their head-quarters at
the drug-store. They had a stormy time when
they first came together, and Tom announced his
readiness to thrash all the boys who had interfered
with Loren during the paddle race, provided
they would come one at a time; but Prime
and a few others exerted themselves to bring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>order out of the confusion, and through their
efforts Tom was elected president of the new
canoe club which was organized at once. But
that did not satisfy him. If he could have had
his own way in the matter, he would have preferred
to be a respected member of the other
club without any office at all. Besides, Prime
and his friends could not forget that Tom, a
new-comer, had deliberately “booked” himself
and his cousins for all the best races, in
utter disregard of the rights of those who
ought to have been allowed to win. They
never quite forgave him for that, and there was
not that harmony in the new club that there
ought to have been in order to insure its prosperity.
Tom was also elected short-stop in
Prime’s ball-club, and in the first match game
that was played, had the gratification of putting
out Joe Wayring and Arthur Hastings
every time they went to the bat. That did
Tom more good than any thing he had accomplished
since he came to Mount Airy, although
he did feel rather mean when Joe and Arthur
complimented him on his swift and accurate
throwing.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>At the next meeting of the Toxophilites
many vacancies were made by the resignation
of boys who knew that they stood a fine chance
of being expelled for what they had done at
the canoe meet, and by the voluntary withdrawal
of a number of others, who preferred
Prime’s company and Noble’s to the companionship
of fellows who were willing to be ruled
by a lot of girls.</p>

<p class='c019'>In the new club, of which Loren Farnsworth
was chosen secretary, there were no
restrictions laid upon cribbage, cigars and
billiards, and so very good-natured was
the master bowman, that he did not even object
to pipes when his men were drilling in the
ranks. But he insisted on prompt and regular
attendance at all the meetings, because he
wanted his company to march in the procession
on the next 4th of July.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Say, captain,” exclaimed Tom Bigden one
night after the long, fatiguing drill was over.
“We had forty men in line to-night, and I
think we went through the school of the company
in a very creditable way, if some of us
are green. Couldn’t we get up a street parade
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>just to show the Toxophilites that some folks
can do things as well as others?”</p>

<p class='c019'>The captain was Frank Noble, and a very
good drill-master he had proved himself to be;
although he was hardly strict enough to suit a
veteran, seeing that he permitted his men to
smoke in the ranks.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I have been thinking about that,” replied
the captain, as the young archers gathered
about him after putting their long bows away
in the lockers. “But I think it would be better
to wait awhile. It will not be long before
the lake will be frozen over, and then we will
give an exhibition drill on the ice. What’s the
matter with that?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Nothing,” shouted all the boys. “It’s the
very thing.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, then, in order to accustom ourselves
to the movements and evolutions, let every fellow
bring his rollers next Thursday night, and
we will see what we can do with them.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The boys thought it the best thing they had
ever heard of, but Scott had a suggestion to
make.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why can’t we rent the rink for a few
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>nights?” said he. “This armory is hardly
large enough, and besides, the floor isn’t as
smooth as it might be.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“We could engage the rink, of course,”
replied the captain. “But if we do, the Toxophilites
will find out what is going on, and
we don’t want them to know any thing about
it.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why, as to that, they are bound to know
about it,” said Tom. “We can’t keep it from
them. You know what a fearful noise rollers
make, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, we can’t help that,” answered
Frank. “If we do our drilling here, they
can’t look through the windows and see what
we are about, as they could if we drilled at the
rink. Now, if you want to go into this, you
must be on hand every night. I will promise
to get you in fine trim by the time the ice is in
condition, if you will only attend to business.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I wonder if we couldn’t get up a competitive
drill with the Toxophilites?” said
Loren.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Not much,” replied Prime, with a laugh.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>“There are too many raw recruits among
us.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“We’ll wait and give them a pull for something
at the next canoe meet,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c019'>“You don’t expect to enter for any of the
prizes next summer, do you?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Of course I do,” replied Tom, “and so do
my cousins. We have sent to New London
for a rowing machine, and intend to keep up
our practice all winter.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“You might as well make kindling wood of
that rowing machine when it comes to hand,
for it will not do you any good as far as
winning a prize from Joe Wayring is concerned,”
said Scott. “You can’t race with
him.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I’ll see how that is,” answered Tom, who
was thinking about one thing while Scott was
thinking about another. “I was under the
impression that when our new club was organized,
it was the sentiment of the members that
we were to challenge their best men for every
thing. Before we can do that, it will be necessary
to have a series of trial races among ourselves
in order to determine who stand the best
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>chance of winning, and I calculate to be one of
the select few.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I believe some of the fellows did speak
about that, but it was all talk,” said Captain
Noble. “You see, Tom, you and I have been
ruled out of every thing by the referee’s decision
on the day of the meet, and you don’t suppose
that our friends here are going to take
part in sports that we can’t have a hand in, do
you? Haven’t we promised to stand by one
another?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh,” said Tom, “I didn’t know what
Scott meant, but I understand the matter now.
The others won’t compete because you and I
can’t. I am glad to hear it.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Of course we are not barred out of any
thing except the sports that take place during
the canoe meet,” added Prime. “We can
play ball or lawn tennis or polo with them.
We can send a team to beat them at target
shooting, and we can enter our sail-boats for
prizes in the regatta; but I, for one, don’t care
to. I’ve had quite enough of that crowd, and
think we can see all the fun we want among
ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>“I think so, too,” said Tom. “I don’t care
for their old canoe club, but I should really
like to see the Toxophilites go to pieces. I’d
see Joe Wayring happy before he should come
into this club with my vote.”</p>

<p class='c019'>If Tom Bigden could have stepped across the
street and up the stairs that led to the neatly
furnished armory and drill-room in which
the Toxophilites were at that moment sitting
down to an oyster supper that some of the new
members had provided for them, he would, perhaps,
have been very much disappointed to discover
that the organization he hated so cordially
because he could not get into it, was not only
in no danger of falling to pieces, but that it
was stronger than it had ever been before. The
vacancies occasioned by the resignation of
Frank Noble and his friends, had been
promptly filled by good fellows, who had
waited long and patiently for an opportunity
to send in their names. More than that (and
this was something that made Tom and his
cousins very angry when they found it out), the
constitution had been amended so that the
membership could be increased to a hundred.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>The Toxophilites were determined that the
Mount Airy Scouts (that was the name of the
new club), should not beat them if they could
help it; but still they did not take in every
one who applied for admission, as the Scouts
did.</p>

<p class='c019'>During the winter Tom Bigden and his
cousins, who grew more vindictive and unreasonable
in their hatred as time progressed,
waged a secret but incessant warfare upon Joe
Wayring and his two chums. They coaxed
Mars from the post-office to the drug-store, and
sent him home with a tin can tied to his tail.
They practiced with their long bows at Roy
Sheldon’s fan-tail and tumbler pigeons as often
as the birds ventured over to their side of the
lake. They went across on their skates one
night, and overturned the <i>Young Republic</i>,
which Joe had hauled out on the beach and
housed for the winter; and they even thought
seriously of setting fire to his boat-house, believing
that the blame would be laid upon Matt
Coyle, who was known to be trapping somewhere
in the mountains. Joe knew who it was
that insulted Mars and shot at the pigeons and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>disturbed his sail-boat; but when he saw by
the marks on the door of the boat-house that
somebody had been trying to pull out the staple
that held the hasp, he told his chums that he
had wronged Tom and his cousins by his suspicions,
and that the squatter was the culprit
after all. Beyond a doubt Matt wanted to regain
possession of the canvas canoe; and in
order to save his property, Joe shouldered it
one morning and took it up to his room.</p>

<p class='c019'>The attentive reader, if I am so fortunate as
to have one, will bear in mind that all I have
thus far written is but a repetition of the story
the canvas canoe told me on that bright afternoon
when I was first introduced to him and to
the other merry fellows—the long bows, the
snow-shoes and the toboggan—who found
a home in Joe Wayring’s room. In concluding
his interesting narrative the canoe said:</p>

<p class='c019'>“Now, Fly-rod, you know every thing of
importance that has happened since Tom Bigden
and his cousins first stuck their quarrelsome
noses inside Mount Airy. As I said at
the start, it was necessary that you should hear
the story, or else you would be at a loss to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>account for a good many things that may happen
to you sooner or later. I have an idea
that you are a good sort, and hope we shall pass
many pleasant hours in each other’s company.”</p>

<p class='c019'>I thanked the canoe for his kind wishes and
for the story he had taken so much pains to
tell me, and inquired how he had managed to
live through the long winter that had just
passed.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh, I did well enough,” was his reply.
“In the first place, the long bows and I had
much to talk about, and in the next, Joe often
brings Roy and Arthur up here to spend an
evening; and as they have traveled a good
deal, they are never at a loss for some interesting
topic of conversation. More than that, Joe
and his uncle went off hunting last December,
and when they returned, they brought with
them those conceited things over there—the
snow-shoes and toboggan—who being from
another country, think they are a trifle better
than any body else. But, after all, I have
found them to be very companionable fellows,
and if you can only get them started (like all
Englishmen, they are inclined to be surly at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>first), they can tell you some things about shooting
and trapping that are well worth listening
to.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Do you know what the programme is for
the summer?” I asked, being somewhat anxious
to learn what I had to look forward to.
“Where are we going and what are we going
to do?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, seeing that this is April, it will not
be summer for three months to come,” replied
the canoe. “But you need not expect to
remain idle any longer than next Saturday.
You and I will probably be employed in making
short trips about the village until school
closes for the long vacation. Immediately
after the canoe meet, which in future will be
held on the 3rd of July, so that the members
of the club can have the whole of the vacation
to themselves, you and Joe will go up to Indian
Lake—”</p>

<p class='c019'>“But Matt Coyle is up there,” I interrupted.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Suppose he is!” retorted the canvas canoe.
“Do you think that Joe Wayring is going to
be kept away from his favorite fishing grounds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>just because that outlaw has chosen to take up
his abode there! You don’t know Joe. He’ll
go, you may be sure, and after he gets there,
he’ll give you a chance to show what you can
do with a five pound trout.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why can’t you go?” I inquired. I had
already learned to like my new friend, who had
shown himself to be so good-natured and so
ready to tell me any thing I wanted to know,
and I thought I would rather have him for
company than any body else.</p>

<p class='c019'>“It is possible that I may go, but I haven’t
heard any thing said about it. I should think
I might be of some use to Joe and I would not
be at all in his way.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“But what if that squatter should steal you
again? I suppose you didn’t fare very well
while you were in his hands.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh, I fared well enough,” replied the
canoe, who seemed to have a happy faculty
of accommodating himself to circumstances.
“But I didn’t like the company I was obliged
to keep, I tell you. Whenever Matt Coyle or
his boys took me out on the water, I would
have been only too glad to spill them out if I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>could have done it. I felt particularly savage
on the night Jake used me in making his raid on
that old guide’s potato-patch and smoke-house.
When I saw the skiff coming after me, wouldn’t
I have laughed if I had possessed the power?
I knew that Jake was going to run me on to
that snag, and when I was settling to the bottom,
I told myself that Joe would never leave
me there. I wasn’t hurt at all. I was easily
mended with rosin and tallow and a piece of
canvas, and am just as good as I ever was;
although I confess that I look like a boy who
has been in a fight and has to wear a patch over
his eye.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“How did the squatter make the journey
from his shanty to the creek in which Joe
found you?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, he carried me on his back from the
pond to the river. It took him two days to
do it, for I hindered him all I could by catching
hold of every limb and bush that came
within my reach. When we got to the river,
Matt loaded me to the water’s edge with his
household goods (you will know how I shrank
from contact with them when I tell you that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>the blankets and quilts were so begrimed
with smoke and dirt that Mars could not be
hired to sleep on them), and then one of the
boys got in and paddled me down the stream
while the squatter and the rest of his family
stumbled along the bank. Matt was afraid
to make his camp anywhere near Indian Lake,
because he knew that the guides would be
very likely to burn or otherwise destroy
every thing he had, as they did once before;
so he turned up the creek, and hunted around
until he found a place that suited him. It
was in a secluded glen, about a quarter of a
mile from the creek. He set his boys to work
to build a lean-to, which would afford them
some sort of shelter until they could provide
a better covering for their heads, and started
out with his rifle to get something to eat.
During his rambles he found a smoke-house and
potato-patch which he thought could be easily
robbed, and as soon as he came home, he sent
Jake out on that thieving expedition which
resulted disastrously to him, for he lost his
plunder and me into the bargain. I assure
you I was glad to find myself among friends
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>once more. Why, have you any idea what that
villain meant to do? He was going to make a
pirate of me. He intended, first, to offer himself
as guide for the hotels, and if they
wouldn’t take him, he intended to follow the
guests and their guides along the water courses,
and rob every camp that he found unprotected.
That’s the kind of fellow Matt Coyle is. He
ought to be abolished.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“What became of the fishing-rods he stole
at the time he ran off with you?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, they had worse treatment than I did,
because they were not as useful as I was. They
have been left out in the rain and abused in various
ways, until they don’t look much as they
did when the squatter first got his ugly hands
upon them. I doubt very much if their owners
would have recognized them if they could have
seen them the last time I did.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Will our trip to Indian Lake last all summer?”
I asked.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh, no; only about two weeks. After that,
we shall be packed off on a long journey, either
East or West, I don’t know which, and neither
did Joe the last time I heard him say any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>thing about it. You see, Uncle Joe Wayring
owns large tracks of timber land in Maine and
Michigan. He wants to see them both, for he
has learned that thieves are at work in both
places; but he hasn’t yet made up his mind
which he wants to see the more. When he
does he will tell Joe, and then we shall find out
where we are going.”</p>

<p class='c019'>There were a good many other questions that
I wanted to ask my communicative friend, but
before I could speak again a merry whistle
sounded in the hall below, and somebody
ascended the stairs three at a time. Then I
knew that my master had finished his sail on the
lake, and was coming up to his room to get
ready for supper. He threw the door open
with a bang, school-boy fashion, and walking
straight up to me took me from my case and
gave me a good looking over. He seemed as
delighted as a youngster with his first pair of
red top boots; but I was somewhat chagrined
to learn that he did not have a very exalted
opinion of my capabilities.</p>

<p class='c019'>“That’s a very fine rod, no doubt; but I
expect to break him into a dozen pieces before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>I have had him a month. A two pound
trout will give him more than he wants
to do.”</p>

<p class='c019'>What else Joe was going to say about me I
never knew; for just then the supper bell rang,
and he made all haste to put me back in my
case. After a hasty toilet he bolted out of the
room with the same noise and racket he made
when he came in, and I was at liberty to continue
my conversation with the canvas canoe.
As usual, that useful and talkative individual
spoke first.</p>

<p class='c019'>“What is your opinion of a boy who can
deliberately persecute a fellow like that?”
said he.</p>

<p class='c019'>“He ought to receive the same punishment
you want meted out to Matt Coyle; he ought
to be abolished,” I replied. “But Joe doesn’t
appear to think much of me.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Don’t you worry about that,” said the
canoe, encouragingly. “You will not wonder
at it when you have made the acquaintance of
his bait-rod—if you ever do; I mean the one
that was stolen from him. He’s a big heavy
fellow, and strong enough to jerk a four pound
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>black bass from the water without any nonsense.
You can’t do that, and Joe isn’t certain
that he can handle you. He doesn’t distrust
you any more than he distrusts himself.
There’s one thing I forgot to tell you,” added
the canoe, “and that is, if any misfortune befalls
you, you can lay it to Tom Bigden. I heard
enough during my short captivity to satisfy
me that he was the chap who put it into Matt’s
head to steal Joe’s property. Matt is bad
enough, goodness knows; but the advice Tom
Bigden gave him made him worse. That is one
of the secrets of which I spoke at the beginning
of my story, and it troubles me all the time. I
am sure that if I could talk to Joe about five
minutes, I should feel easier; but that’s something
I can’t do.”</p>

<p class='c019'>At my request the historian then went on to tell
of other interesting and exciting incidents in Joe
Wayring’s life, but as they have no bearing
with my own exploits and adventures I omit
them now, although they may appear at
some future period. By the time he grew
weary of talking it was ten o’clock, and darkness
had settled down over the room; but just
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>as I was composing myself for the night, the
door opened and Joe Wayring came in. Making
good his boast, that if folks would let his
property alone, he could find any thing he
wanted on the darkest of nights and without
the aid of a lamp, Joe caught up the creel with
one hand, seized me with the other, and carrying
us both down-stairs, deposited us on the kitchen
table beside something that was covered with a
snow-white cloth. Then he busied himself for a
few minutes about the stove, getting kindling
and light wood together so that a fire could be
readily started; and after I had watched his
movements for a while, I made up my mind that a
campaign of some sort was in prospect. When he
took the light and went out I said to the creel:</p>

<p class='c019'>“Do you happen to know what day this is?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“It’s Friday,” he replied. “To-morrow
will be Saturday, and I should judge by the
looks of things, that we are going to make our
first trip after trout.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Do you know by experience how a youngster

  <h2 class='c011'>CHAPTER XV. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>MY FIRST TRIP TO INDIAN LAKE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_5 c018'>THE next morning, just as the clock was
striking the hour of four, I was aroused
from a reverie into which I had fallen by a hasty
step, followed by a blinding glare of light, and
Joe Wayring came hurrying into the kitchen.
He didn’t look much as he did the last time I
saw him, and if it hadn’t been for his curly head
and blue eyes, I don’t think I should have recognized
him. But he was a nobby looking
fellow, all the same, dressed as he was in a
neat suit of duck, dyed to a dead grass shade,
a light helmet with a peak before and behind,
and leggings and gaiters instead of boots. Joe
was not the boy to make himself uncomfortable,
or to go about in a ragged coat and with
his hair sticking out of the top of his cap, just
because he intended to spend the day in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>woods out of sight of every body. He knew
of anglers and hunters who affected that style,
and they could follow it, if they wanted to,
but he wouldn’t. Leggings and gaiters were
easier to walk in than heavy boots, and whole
clothes looked better than shabby ones.</p>

<p class='c019'>Placing the lamp on the table Joe began
bustling about the kitchen, and in a very few
minutes the fire was started and the tea-kettle
filled. Then he threw back the cloth before
spoken of, revealing a substantial lunch, a
liberal portion of which he proceeded to pack
away in the creel.</p>

<p class='c019'>About the time the coffee was ready, the
door opened again, and Uncle Joe came in.
He, too, was dressed for the woods, and carried
a rod of some sort in one hand and a creel in the
other. The latter must have been a fine looking
article in his day, but now he was as
weather-beaten as any old sailor. And that
was not to be wondered at, for he had traveled
much, and had seen many hardships. He had
accompanied his master from one end of
the country to the other. He had held
captive for him many a nice breakfast of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>grayling captured in Michigan waters, and
carried his dinner while he was fighting with
the big trout in Rangeley Lakes. He went
with him on one of his Western tours, and
would certainly have fallen into the hands of
the Utes when they arose in rebellion and
massacred all the whites they could find, had
it not been for the fact that he was slung over
his master’s shoulder, and the latter was in
too great a hurry to stop and throw him off.
He had many thrilling recollections of the
Indian Lake country, for he had been capsized
on the rapids more times than he could remember.
He was a good talker, and as full of
stories as the canvas canoe.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, sir,” said Uncle Joe, as he deposited
his rod and creel on the table, “what are the
prospects?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Couldn’t be better,” replied the boy. “It’s
cloudy, and there is every sign of rain before
noon.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I hope it will stay cloudy, but I can’t say
that I want to see it rain,” said Uncle Joe, as
he drew a chair up to the table and took the
cup of coffee his nephew poured out for him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>“The bushes around the old spring hole are
pretty thick, and I long ago ceased to see any
fun in getting drenched for the sake of catching
a mess of half-pound trout. If they were
salmon, now, the case would be different.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Nevertheless Uncle Joe seemed to be in just
as great a hurry to eat his breakfast and be off
as his nephew was. Ten minutes sufficed to
satisfy their appetites, and in ten minutes more
we were on the outskirts of the village, and
moving up an old log road toward the spring
hole, where I was to make my first attempt to
take a fish. I dreaded the ordeal, for I did not
have as much confidence in myself as I would
have had if my master had not spoken so
slightingly of me.</p>

<p class='c019'>How far it was from the village to the spring
hole, I am sure I don’t know. It seemed like
a long journey to me, although it was enlivened
by stories of travel and adventure from Uncle
Joe, in which I became deeply interested.
Presently Joe, who was leading the way,
pushed aside the bushes in front of him, disclosing
to view a small body of water fringed
with lily-pads and surrounded on all sides by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>high and thickly wooded hills; and I knew instinctively
that we had reached the end of our
tramp, and that the time had come for me to
show what I could do. There seemed to be
abundant opportunity for me to do good work
if I was capable of it. While I was being taken
out of my case, I noticed that now and then
there was a slight commotion in the water, just
outside the lilies, and I knew it was occasioned
by trout jumping from the water, even before
Joe Wayring said so.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Just look at them!” he exclaimed, in great
excitement. “They are having a high old
time among themselves. I wouldn’t take a
dollar for my chance of going home with a full
creel. There! Did you see that whopper?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Put on a white miller and a brown hackle,
and give me your rod as quick as you can,”
answered his uncle. “I saw him, and if he
comes up again within seventy or eighty feet
of us, I will make an effort to take him.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Do you mean to say that you can throw a
fly as far as that?” inquired Joe.</p>

<p class='c019'>“That depends upon the rod. I’d like to
have the first try with it, if you have no objection,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>for I want to see whether or not you’ve
got a good bargain.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Of course Joe had no objection. As soon as
I was ready for business he passed me over to
his uncle, and when I felt his strong fingers
close around me, I knew that I was in the hands
of one who would make me show off to the best
possible advantage.</p>

<p class='c019'>“There he is again! Give him the flies,
quick!” cried Joe, suddenly.</p>

<p class='c019'>Uncle Joe’s movements were characterized
by what sportsmen are wont to call “deliberate
quickness”. He was so very deliberate, in
fact, that his nephew began to show unmistakable
signs of impatience; but still he did
not waste a single second of valuable time.
Reeling off as much line as the close proximity
of the bushes behind would permit him to use,
Uncle Joe gave me a smart upward and backward
fling and then struck down toward the
water. This movement caused the line to fly
through the air like a whip lash, only it grew
in length all the while; and when the flies
were directly over the swirl the trout had made
when he went down, the motion of the reel was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>stopped by a slight pressure of the angler’s
thumb, and the tempting lures settled upon the
water as lightly as a couple of feathers.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I never can learn to do that,” said Joe,
despondingly. “It requires altogether too
much skill for my clumsy—Well, sir, you’ve
got him as sure as the world.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The hook was fast to something, that was
plain; but I thought at first that Uncle Joe
had caught a snag or a lily-pad. There was a
jerk that made me wonder, and in an instant
more I was bent almost half double; but with
all the strain that was brought to bear upon
me, the thing at the other end of the line, whatever
it was, did not give an inch. On the contrary,
it started and ran off toward the middle
of the spring hole; and then I began to realize
that I was doing battle with a trout of the
largest size. Now was the time to show my
master that he had been much mistaken in me.</p>

<p class='c019'>I need not stop to go into the particulars of
the fight, for every boy who has caught a heavy
trout on a light rod will know just what happened;
and besides, to be frank with you, I
don’t remember much about it. Neither does
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>Joe Wayring, who was so highly excited that
he could not stand still. I recollect he afterward
told his chums that the fish jumped clear
out of the water two or three times, and then
started from the middle of the spring hole and
ran toward the angler at the top of his speed,
trying to loosen the line so that the hook
would drop out of his mouth; but the automatic
reel took up the slack as fast as he made
it, and his mad rushes about the spring hole
had no other result than to tire him out, so that
he could offer but feeble resistance when he was
reeled in to the bank. The moment he was
brought within reach Joe slipped a landing net
under him and lifted him out.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Two pounds and three ounces,” he almost
shouted, after he had weighed him on his
pocket scales. “Now, Uncle Joe, what’s your
opinion of that rod?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“A fair sized fish for these waters,” said
Uncle Joe, as he stepped to the edge
of the spring hole for another cast. “As
for the rod—it’s as good a one as you need
wish for. If you will take care of him, he will
last as long as you will, barring accident.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>I will not dwell upon the incidents of the
day, for I must hasten on to tell you what
happened to me during my first visit to Indian
Lake. It will be enough to say that Joe and
his uncle enjoyed themselves, as they always
did whenever they went anywhere together,
and that my master after an hour or two of
assiduous practice, learned to make short casts
with tolerable accuracy, and to show considerable
skill in handling the fish he hooked.
When the two went home a little before dark
Joe’s creel was not as full as his uncle’s, but
the few trout he captured with his light
tackle, afforded him more genuine sport than
twice the number of bass taken on a heavy
bait-rod.</p>

<p class='c019'>That day was the beginning of a busy season
for me. Every Saturday, rain or shine, found
me at the spring hole or wandering along the
banks of some of the numerous streams that
ran into Mirror Lake. I caught a good many
fish, soon got over my nervousness, and looked
forward to the long summer vacation with as
much impatience as Joe himself. It came at
last, being ushered in by a canoe meet on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>3rd of July, and a grand parade on the 4th, in
which the Toxophilites and Scouts both took
part. There was a good deal of rivalry between
these two organizations—so much, indeed, that
the usual exhibition drill at the park was
given by the military company, thus putting
it out of the power of either club to crow over
the other. But still there was considerable
crowing done, especially by Tom Bigden and a
few envious fellows like him.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Don’t you remember what vociferous
applause the Toxophilites received last 4th?”
said he, to his cousins.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Yes; and I remember how mad you were
about it, too,” replied Loren.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I know it. I couldn’t bear to see them
throw on so many airs, but I little thought
that I should aid in making them take back
seats at their next parade. I have yet to see
any one who will say that the Scouts didn’t do
just as fine marching in the procession as the
Toxophilites did.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Of course I did not see the parade, and neither
did I witness the sports that were held during
the canoe meet, for I was shut up in Joe’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>room so far from a window that I could not
tell what was going on out-doors. But I heard
the music of the band, and the cheers that arose
whenever some lucky fellow carried off a prize,
and the exciting and amusing incidents that
happened during those two days of festivity,
were so often talked of in my hearing, that I
was pretty well posted after all. I was glad to
learn that my master won the paddle race very
easily, and that he pushed Roy and Arthur so
closely in the hurry-skurry race that the referee
had half a mind to order another contest. But
Joe and Arthur said that Roy was ahead, and
as the other boys backed them up, Roy was
awarded the prize. There was no attempt at
fouling this time. Every thing was conducted
fairly, as it always had been previous to Tom
Bigden’s arrival in the village, and every member
of the club won or lost on his merits.</p>

<p class='c019'>The parade being over, there was nothing to
keep Joe and his two chums at home, and on
the evening of the 4th they began making preparations
for their annual trip to Indian Lake.
Shortly after supper Joe Wayring came into
the room, and having exchanged his uniform
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>for a suit of working clothes, he shouldered my
friend, the canvas canoe, and carried him down
stairs. Half an hour later he came back after
the creel and me. He took us down to the
boat-house and there we found the canoe,
snugly tucked away in his chest like a tired
boy in his little bed.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Hurrah for me!” exclaimed the canoe,
after Joe had gone out locking the door behind
him. “I am going to Indian Lake, too. Now,
if Joe can only keep clear of Matt Coyle, we’ll
see some fun before we get back. You think you
know something about fishing; but wait until
you get hold of one of those big lake trout, and
then tell me what you think about it.”</p>

<p class='c019'>That was just what I wanted to do, but I
didn’t say so, for fear that when the time came
I might discover that I was not quite so good a
rod as I thought I was.</p>

<p class='c019'>We were so very impatient to be off that the
night was a very long one to us; but at the
first peep of day we heard Joe’s step as he came
down the walk toward the boat-house. He
placed a basket of provisions on the wharf,
mildly scolded Mars for making such a fuss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>over the coming separation, and then came in
after us. Arthur Hastings, Jim and the skiff
were on time, as they always were, and in half
an hour more we had taken Roy Sheldon
on board and were moving gayly down the river.
We camped for the night at the old perch hole,
where the skiff had ridden out that furious
storm a year before, and the boys had fish for
supper. Joe had been told that perch would
rise to a red ibis, but he and I could not prove
the truth of the assertion. Although Arthur
and Roy pulled out the fish as fast as they
could bait their hooks, Joe never got a bite.
The reason was, the water was too deep. His
uncle afterward told him that six feet is about
as far as any fish can be relied upon to rise to a
fly; and sometimes they are too lazy to come
from that depth.</p>

<p class='c019'>On the afternoon on the fourth day we left
the river and turned into a little creek, whose
current was so swift that the boys were obliged
to use extra exertion in order to make headway
against it. About an hour after the sun went
down we came to anchor in the mouth of a
brook, and there I made amends for my failure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>at the perch hole. I captured more trout than
both the other rods, and if I had felt so inclined,
could have returned some of the left-handed
compliments they paid me when it was found
that I could not catch a perch in twenty feet of
water; but being peaceably disposed I said
nothing. While the tent was being put up, a
muffled voice came from the chest in which
the canvas canoe was packed away. The
cover being shut down, I had to listen intently
in order to catch what he said to me.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Didn’t I hear some one say something
about trout?” asked the canoe.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I think it very likely,” was my reply.
“There are lots of them in the brook; almost
as many as there in the spring hole at Mount
Airy.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Then I know where we are,” said my
imprisoned friend. “Did you see an ugly looking
snag about a mile below? Well, there’s one
there, and it’s the one Jake Coyle ran into the
night I was sunk in the creek. The fight I
told you about took place right here. Have
you seen or heard any thing of the squatter?”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>“No, I haven’t; but I know that Joe and
his friends are keeping a bright lookout for
him.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I am glad to hear it, and I hope they will
not relax their vigilance just because Matt keeps
himself out of sight. His shanty is over there
in the woods on the right hand side of the
creek. I’ll bet he is there now, and that he has
had his eye on the skiff ever since she came into
this part of the country. Mark my words:
Joe will hear from him before he sees Mount
Airy again.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh, I hope not,” said I.</p>

<p class='c019'>“So do I,” answered the canoe. “But I
became well enough acquainted with Matt and
his family during the short time I lived with
them, to know that they do not intend to leave
here unless they are driven away, as they were
last year when they came to our village. Why,
this is the best place in the world for a man who
is too lazy to work, and who is not above taking
things without leave. Game and fish are
abundant. All the guides cultivate little
patches of ground, and keep a few pigs and
chickens, and as they are away from home a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>good part of the time, their property is left
to the care of their wives and children. They
can’t stand guard day and night, and consequently
it is no trouble at all for Matt to steal
all he wants. He has a fine hiding-place now,
and as he and his family make it a point to
travel different routes every time they go away
from the shanty or return to it, they don’t
leave much of a trail for the guides to follow, if
they should make up their minds to hunt them
up. Another thing,” added the canoe, in a
tone of anxiety, “Matt hates Joe and his chums
for two reasons: First, because their fathers
turned him out of Mount Airy, and second,
because they gave him such a pelting with
potatoes the last time they were up here. If he
is here, he will try to have revenge for that;
now you see if he doesn’t.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The canvas canoe spoke confidently, and his
words occasioned me no little uneasiness; but
I was greatly relieved to learn from the conversation,
to which I listened while the boys were
eating supper, that they were fully alive to the
dangers of the situation, and that they did not
mean to let the squatter take them off their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>guard. They were happy in the belief that
Matt could not attack them, except at long
range, because he had no boat to bring him
alongside the skiff. It never occurred to them
that he had had plenty of time to steal or build
one, and that was where they made their mistake.</p>

<p class='c019'>Up to this time we had had pleasant weather;
but this particular night was a rainy one. The
big drops began coming down just after the
tent was put up. Then I realized for the first
time what a comfortable home it was that the
boys had provided for themselves. The canvas
canoe and I lay on the forward locker, with
the two bait-rods, the dip-net and the cocker
spaniel to keep us company. On the bottom
of the boat in the cock-pit sat the three chums,
on either side of a table which they had made
by pushing the movable thwarts close together.
On the table, which was covered with a white
napkin, was an array of dishes, plates and
cups, all of tin, which were filled to over-flowing
with ham sandwiches, bread and butter,
cake, ripe fruit of various kinds and trout,
done to a turn. On the stern locker stood the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>little stove over which Arthur had cooked the
fish and made the tea, and above it hung the
jack-lamp that was kept burning all night. If
any thing happened—if the wind arose and the
anchor dragged, or prowlers of any sort came
about—the boys wanted a light to work by.
Over all was the tent, with the rain coming
gently down on the top of it. One side curtain
was rolled up to admit the air, but the other
was buttoned securely to the gunwale. Joe
wasn’t going to have the squatter slip up and
send a club into the cock-pit before he knew it.
Taken altogether it was a cozy, home-like
scene, and I no longer wondered why it was
that Joe and his friends looked forward to the
summer vacation with such lively anticipations
of pleasure.</p>

<p class='c019'>The boys slept soundly that night, lulled by
the pattering of the rain on the roof over their
heads, but the sun did not find them in bed. I
caught more than my share of the trout they
ate for breakfast, and that afternoon was given
an opportunity to try my skill on larger game,
to wit, a four pound black bass. I may add,
too, that I got my first ducking, and witnessed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>the liveliest kind of a foot race. But I can’t
say that I enjoyed it; there was too much depending
on it.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Do you remember the last time we ate
breakfast here?” said Joe, as he drew up the
anchor while his companions shipped the oars
and pulled up the creek toward the pond. “If
my memory serves me, Matt Coyle made the
mouth of this brook uncomfortably warm for
us for a few minutes. What would we have
done if Roy hadn’t been smart enough to keep
some of the potatoes out of that bag? I wonder
where the old chap is now?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Probably he is a hundred miles away,” answered
Arthur. “You don’t suppose that the
people who live around the lake are going to
let him stay here and steal them out of house
and home, do you?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I am of the opinion that he and his worthless
family were driven away from here long
ago,” said Roy. “But still I don’t believe
in trusting any thing to luck. We needn’t
go ashore unless we want to, and Matt can’t
bother us while we are lying at anchor. He’s
got no boat, and he isn’t foolish enough to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>swim off to us, for we gave him a lesson the
last time we were here that he will remember
as long as he lives.”</p>

<p class='c019'>We left the mouth of the brook at an early
hour, and about four in the afternoon entered
the pond, where I heard Joe say we would
remain until the bread and bacon gave out,
when we would go over to Indian Lake and lay
in a fresh supply. Now Joe was sorry that he
had left his bait-rod behind. The pond was
noted for the number and fighting qualities of
its bass, and Joe had nothing to catch them
with; at least that was what he told his friends,
adding that he was afraid to trust so heavy
work to me.</p>

<p class='c019'>“You’d better be afraid,” assented Roy.
“If you don’t want that fine rod of yours
smashed into a thousand pieces, you had better
not try to catch a bass with it. But I’ll tell you
what you might do, if you don’t care to sit idly
here while Art and I catch all the fish and see
all the fun. You might go up to the little
perch hole and throw a fly there. Perhaps you
will find the perch in the pond more accommodating
than they were back there in the river.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>“How about our esteemed friend, the squatter?”
said Arthur.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh, he can’t trouble me,” answered Joe,
who was already preparing to act upon Roy’s
suggestion. “His shanty is away off there
somewhere, while the perch hole lies a mile or
more in the opposite direction. There is a wide
and deep river between the two, and how is
Matt going to cross it without a boat? I am of
Roy’s opinion that he was driven away from
here long ago.”</p>

<p class='c019'>While Joe was talking in this way he had
taken the canvas canoe from his chest, and now
under his skillful hands my old friend was fast
assuming his usual symmetrical proportions.
In less than ten minutes he was floating gracefully
alongside the skiff.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Come on, Fly-rod,” said he, “and I will
show you what a canvas canoe can do when he
is managed by some one who understands his
business. You never took a ride with me, did
you?”</p>

<p class='c019'>No, I never had, and if the truth must be
told, I never wanted to take a second ride with
him. He may have been “the boss boat” on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>the rapids, as he often boasted, but he was a
very unfortunate craft all the same, and before
the day was over I had reason to believe that
Joe would have seen more sport during his two
weeks’ outing if he had left the canoe safe in
his room at Mount Airy. I came back to the
skiff, but he didn’t.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>
  <h2 class='c011'>CHAPTER XVI. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>AN EXPLOIT AND A SURPRISE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_5 c018'>AS I could not comply with my friend’s
invitation to “come on”, I was obliged
to wait until Joe had exchanged his heavy
boots for the buckskin moccasins he always
wore whenever he went anywhere with the
canoe. This being done, we pushed away from
the skiff, and moved leisurely up the pond
toward the perch hole, Joe whistling merrily
as he plied the paddle. I do not think he was
quite so light-hearted when he came back.</p>

<p class='c019'>Half an hour’s paddling sufficed to bring us
to our destination. If I hadn’t heard Joe say
that the perch hole was located in the mouth
of a creek, I should not have known it, for it
looked to me more like an arm of the pond
which set back into the land. When I was
taken from my case, after the anchor had been
dropped overboard, I took note of the fact that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>one could not see more than twenty or thirty
feet up the creek, a high wooded point limiting
the range of vision in that direction. I didn’t
know at the time why I observed this, but I
thought of it afterward.</p>

<p class='c019'>Joe made his first cast with a scarlet ibis,
and the result was surprising to both of us.
The fish that took the lure did not give much
of a bite—I have known a half-pound trout to
seize the bait with more vim than he did—but
when Joe fastened the hook with a scientific
twist of his wrist, I couldn’t have doubled up
quicker if he had caught a log.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Scotland’s a burning! what’s that?”
exclaimed Joe, speaking so rapidly that the
words seemed to come out all at once. “I
declare, it’s a bass,” he added a moment later,
as the green and bronze side of the beautiful
captive could be seen for an instant just under
the surface of the water. “I wish he was at
the bottom of the pond, for he’ll break my rod
and I’ll have no more fishing this trip.”</p>

<p class='c019'>But Joe did not give up because he thought
he was going to be worsted in the fight. He
brought into play all the skill of which he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>master, and after an exciting struggle of fully
half an hour’s duration, caught up the landing
net and hauled into the canoe the largest
thing in the shape of a fish I had seen up to
that time. He was killed at once, the pocket
scales were brought into use, and the weight
of the “catch” was written down in Joe’s
note-book.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Whew?” panted the boy, pulling out his
handkerchief and wiping the big drops of perspiration
from his forehead. “If that wasn’t
a tough battle I wouldn’t say so. I never supposed
that little rod could catch a fish like
this. Hello, here! It’s getting dark already.
I know the fellows will laugh at me for coming
back with a single fish, but I don’t believe
they will be able to show one that will weigh
more.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Joe jumped to his feet as he spoke, and
made all haste to put me away in my case. He
stood with his face to the pond while he worked,
and consequently he did not see what I did.
My attention was first called to it by an
exclamation from the canvas canoe who said
in a suppressed and excited whisper:</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>“Upon my word, there’s that everlasting
Matt Coyle again. He’ll gobble the whole of
us this time.”</p>

<p class='c019'>I looked over Joe’s shoulder, and there in
the bight of the bend, with its ugly nose just
sticking around the high wooded point of which
I have spoken, was a clumsy scow built of
rough boards that had doubtless been stolen
from some saw-mill. In the scow sat Matt
Coyle and his two boys. I had heard them
described so often that I should have recognized
them at once, even if the canoe had not told
me who they were. They held their paddles
poised in the air, and Matt who sat in the bow,
having raised his hand to attract the attention
of his boys, was now pointing silently toward
my master, and going through a series of
contortions with his head and eyes that must
have had a volume of meaning in them. At
any rate Jake and Sam understood them, for
they dipped their paddles into the water, and
the scow moved around the point and turned
directly toward us, while the squatter prepared
himself for business by taking off his hat and
pushing back his sleeves. I trembled all over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>with excitement and alarm, and so did the
canoe.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh, why don’t Joe turn around?” cried
the latter. “Matt intends to take him by
surprise, and he’ll be alongside in half a minute
more.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Just then one of the boys allowed his paddle
to rub against the side of the scow. The noise
he made was very slight, but it was loud enough
to attract the attention of Joe Wayring, who
faced about to find his enemies within less
than twenty feet of him. He was so astonished
to see them there, that for a few seconds he
could neither move nor speak. He stood as
motionless and silent as a wooden boy; while
Matt, seeing that he was discovered, snatched
up his paddle and raised a yell of triumph.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Now I reckon I’ll have my boat back an’
you into the bargain,” he shouted, swinging
his paddle around his head and then shaking
it savagely at Joe. “When I get my hands
onto you, the way I’ll wear the hickories out
on your back will extonish you wuss nor any
thing you ever see.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“An’ won’t I punch your head though, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>pay you fur hittin’ me with that there tater
up there in the creek last summer?” chimed
in Jake. “I guess yes.”</p>

<p class='c019'>These threatening words called Joe to his
senses. He knew that he would not have time
to pull up the anchor and escape in his canoe,
for he had paid out a good deal of rope in order
to place himself in the best possible position
for casting, and before he could haul it in, his
enemies would be upon him. There was but
one way to elude them, and that was to take
to the water and to trust to his powers as a
swimmer. It looked like a slim chance, but
the odds of three against one were too heavy to
be successfully resisted, and what else could he
do? As quick as a flash he turned again, and
without releasing his hold upon me, took a
header from the stern of the canoe.</p>

<p class='c019'>“So that there’s your game, is it?” yelled
the squatter. “Wal, it suits us, I reckon.
Never mind the boat, Jakey. She’s fast
anchored, and will stay there till we want her.
Take after the ’ristocrat whose dad won’t let
honest folks live onto his land less’n they’ve
got a pocketful of money to pay him fur it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>Jest let me get a good whack at him with my
paddle an’ he’ll stop, I bet you. Hold on,
there, ’cause it’ll be wuss fur you if you don’t.”</p>

<p class='c019'>In obedience to Matt’s instructions the scow
was turned toward the swimmer; but although
Jake and Sam exerted themselves to the
utmost, they could not cut him off from the
shore. Joe made astonishing headway. There
were but few boys, or men either, in Mount
Airy who could swim as fast as he could, and
he afterward said that he never made better
time than he did when he was trying to get
away from Matt and his boys. He was afraid
of the lily-pads which lined the banks of the
creek on both sides, so he swam down the
stream until he was clear of them before he
attempted to make a landing; but Matt, believing
that he could do better on shore, dropped
his own paddle into the water, turned into the
lilies and tried to force the scow through them.
That was a lucky thing for Joe Wayring. The
strong stems of the lilies were entwined about
one another in all sorts of ways, and the squatter
stuck fast in them before he had made half
a dozen strokes.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>“Back out! Back out!” shouted Matt,
who was quickly made aware that he had committed
a blunder. “Be in a hurry, or he’ll
get sich a start on us that we can’t never ketch
him. Hold up, there!” he went on, jumping
to his feet and swinging his paddle around his
head as if he were on the point of launching
it at the object of his wrath. “Come
back, or it’ll be wuss fur you. You hear me, I
reckon.”</p>

<p class='c019'>In the meantime Joe made good his landing,
and looked over his shoulder to see the heavy
paddle coming toward him, end over end. It
struck the ground near him, and was immediately
sent back where it came from with all
the force that the boy’s sinewy arm could give
it. Flying wide of the mark for which it was
intended, the broad blade hit Jake fairly in the
face, giving him such a splitting headache that
he could not take part in the pursuit that followed.
This was another lucky thing for Joe.
Jake was the best runner in the squatter’s
family, and although there is not the slightest
doubt that he would have been soundly thrashed
if he had succeeded in overtaking Joe, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>might have been able to detain him until his
father and brother could come to his assistance,
and then Joe would have had more on his
hands than he could attend to.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Joe in an awkward fix.</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>“That’s another thing we’ve got to pay you
fur when we get our hands on you,” yelled
Matt, who was almost beside himself. “Work
lively in backin’ out, or he’ll have a mile the
start of us before we tech the shore.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Jake, who had dropped his paddle and sat
holding his chin in his hands, paid no attention
to the order; but Matt and Sam worked to
such good purpose that they finally succeeded
in backing the scow out of the lilies into clear
water. When they reached the bank, Joe
Wayring was out of sight; but they knew
which way he had gone, and at once set out in
pursuit; while Jake stayed in the scow and
howled dismally.</p>

<p class='c019'>Joe ran like a deer, and made surprising progress
in spite of the logs and bushes that
obstructed his way. He was very quiet in his
movements, but Matt and his boy made so
much noise that it was an easy matter to keep
track of them and tell just how far they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>behind. At last the squatter, seeing that he
was not going to capture my master by following
him on foot, thought it best to change his
tactics.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Sam,” he shouted, in stentorian tones,
“go back to the creek, and you an’ Jakey take
the canoe an’ paddle down the pond so’s to
cut him off when he tries to swim off to the
skiff. You understand what I say to you, I
reckon.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Joe understood it, whether Sam did or not
and it put new speed into him. He ran so
swiftly that he very soon left his single pursuer
out of hearing, but he exhausted himself in the
effort, and when he dashed out of the bushes
and stopped on the bank in plain sight of the
skiff, he was so nearly out of breath that he
could not raise a shout to draw the attention
of his chums, who were hard at work
putting up the tent. But Jim saw him,
and announced the fact by a joyful bark,
followed by a vigorous wagging of his tail.
Arthur and Roy looked toward the bank, and
there stood Joe, swinging his arms wildly about
his head. When he saw that he had attracted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>their notice, he pointed to the woods, and then
up the pond toward the canvas canoe which
was coming down with all the speed that Jake
and Sam could give it. The boys in the skiff
saw and understood. The anchor came up
quicker than it ever did before, the oars were
shipped, and the skiff came toward the bank
with a heavy bone in her teeth. By this time
Matt Coyle arrived within hearing again, and
Joe, fearing that he might make his appearance
before his friends could rescue him, stepped
into the water and struck out to meet the skiff.
Jake and Sam yelled savagely at him, and redoubled
their efforts to place themselves between
him and his friends; but they might as
well have saved their breath and strength. The
skiff came up rapidly, and Joe knew that he
was saved. Suddenly a bright idea suggested
itself to him—one that would have enabled
him to turn the tables upon the squatter very
neatly, if his friends had only been prompt to
act upon it. Raising himself as far out of the
water as he could, he called out:</p>

<p class='c019'>“Boys, never mind me. I’ve got my second
wind now, and can swim for an hour. Go up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>there and capture my canoe, or else run over
her and send her to the bottom. Don’t let
those villains take her away from me again.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“All right,” replied Roy, still giving away
strong on his oar. “We’ll get your canoe back
for you, but we will take care of you first.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“No, no!” insisted Joe. “Capture or sink
the canoe first, and attend to me afterward. I
am all right, I tell you. I can easily keep
afloat until you come back.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why, boy, you haven’t got a breath to
spare,” said Arthur. “I know it by the way
you talk. Come in out of the wet.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“You held fast to your fly-rod through it
all, didn’t you?” said Roy, as he took me from
Joe’s hand.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Yes. I didn’t know whether or not I could
outrun them, and I wanted something to defend
myself with in case they came up with me.”</p>

<p class='c019'>When Joe tried to climb into the skiff, he
found that he was by no means in as good condition
as he thought he was. He could scarcely
help himself at all, and his chums were obliged
to pull him in by main strength. The
moment they let go of him he sank down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>against the stern locker and panted loudly;
but he was as full of determination as ever.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Now go up and sink the canoe,” he almost
gasped.</p>

<p class='c019'>But a single glance was enough to show Arthur
and Roy that it was too late to do any thing with
the canoe. Jake and his brother heard the
order that Joe shouted at his friends while he
was in the water, and made all haste to put
themselves out of harm’s way. When Joe was
hauled into the skiff they were so close to the
shore that all attempts to intercept them would
have been unavailing.</p>

<p class='c019'>“It’s no use, Joe,” said Arthur. “They’re
too far off, and there’s Matt Coyle standing on
the bank.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“But for Joe’s sake we will see what we can
do,” exclaimed Roy.</p>

<p class='c019'>As he spoke, he opened the forward locker
and took from it a stout paper bag. When he
first put it there, Arthur and Joe supposed
that it contained lemons; but when Roy opened
it, they saw that it was filled with potatoes.</p>

<p class='c019'>“They helped us out of a scrape once, and
why shouldn’t they do so again?” said Roy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>“My plan is to pull into shore, drive Matt and
his boys into the bushes, clap onto the canoe
with the boat-hook and tow her out into the
pond.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Arthur declared that that was the way to do
it, but subsequent events proved that it wasn’t.
They laid hold of their oars again, but before
the skiff had gone far toward the shore, Joe
Wayring, who had by this time recovered his
power of speech and motion, announced that
Roy’s plan wouldn’t work at all, and that it
was useless to make any effort to sink or capture
the canoe. And the rowers found it so
when they faced about and looked toward the
shore.</p>

<p class='c019'>The squatter and his boys had dragged
the canoe from the water, and were now carrying
her back into the bushes where they knew
the boys would not dare go after it.</p>

<p class='c019'>Matt had not yet forgotten the tactics they
used when he and his boys tried to club them
out of their boat the year before. He was very
much afraid of Roy, and when the latter
ceased rowing and got upon his feet to see
what had been done with the canoe, Matt and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>his allies ran into the woods like so many
frightened turkeys.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I’m onto your little game,” said the squatter
in a triumphant tone, as he looked out
from behind the tree that sheltered him.
“You don’t fire no more taters at me if I
know it. Your boat is here, an’ if you want
it wusser’n we do, come an’ get it. ’Tain’t
much account nohow.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I’m going to bust it into a million pieces
to pay you fur that there whack you gin me
with pap’s paddle a while ago,” shouted the
invisible Jake, who would not show so much
as the top of his cap to the boys in the skiff.
“I’ve stood jest about all the poundin’ I’m
goin’ to.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“What did you do to him, Joe?” inquired
Arthur, as he and Roy turned the skiff around
and pulled back toward their anchorage.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Matt threw his paddle at me when he saw
that I was about to slip through his fingers,
and I threw it back,” answered Joe. “It
didn’t hit Matt, as I meant it should, but it came
pretty near knocking Jake out of the
scow.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>“The scow?” repeated Roy. “Have they
got a boat of their own, I’d like to know.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Joe replied that they had a boat in their
possession (of course he didn’t know where
they got it, or whether or not they had any
right to call it their own), and then went on to
tell of the exploit I had performed at the perch
hole, and of the surprise that followed close
upon the heels of it. He wound up his story
by saying—</p>

<p class='c019'>“I didn’t have time to draw up my anchor,
so I had to go overboard. I swam the best I
knew how in order to reach the bank before
Matt did; then I raced a mile or more through
the woods in my wet clothes, and that was
what tired me out.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I wonder if we are to find that fellow hanging
around every time we come into the
woods?” said Roy, angrily. “Hallo, here!”</p>

<p class='c019'>A slight splashing in the water drew their
attention at the moment, and Joe and Arthur
started up in alarm, expecting to find that the
squatter and his boys had stolen a march upon
them. There was a canoe close alongside of
them, but the broad-shouldered, brown-whiskered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>man who handled the paddle was
not Matt Coyle or any body like him. He was
one of the hotel guides who had assisted in
driving the squatter out of the Indian Lake
country, and he was looking for him now.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Hallo yourself,” he replied, good-naturedly.
“Well, I swan to man, if there ain’t Roy
Sheldon and—Why, you’re all here, ain’t you?
Say! seen any thing of Matt Coyle since you
have been hanging around?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Mr. Swan, how are you?” exclaimed all the
boys, in a breath. They knew the guide, and
liked him, too.</p>

<p class='c019'>“You have come to the right place to
learn a good deal concerning Matt and his
doings,” continued Roy. “What has he been
up to now?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, you see,” answered the guide, speaking
with so much deliberation that the impatient
boys wanted to hurry him, “he came here
last year from somewhere, and wanted to set
in for a guide; but the hotels down to the lake
wouldn’t have him, ’cause they didn’t think
he was a safe man to trust with a boat, and
Matt, he allowed that he’d fix things so’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>there wouldn’t be no guidin’ for none of
us to do. So he’s took to the woods, and he
robs every camp he can find, if there don’t
happen to be any body around to watch it.
Leastwise we lay it to him, ’cause we know
he’s around here, and some of us thought that
we’d like to take a peep at his shanty, if he’s
got one.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“We can’t tell you where his shanty is,”
said Joe, “but we can show you where Matt
and his boys were not ten minutes ago. He
stole my canvas canoe and gave me a long chase
through the woods. He promised that if he
could get hold of me, he would wear a hickory
out over my back.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Sho!” exclaimed the guide. “What
for?”</p>

<p class='c019'>Joe’s story was a long one, for in order to
make the guide understand how he and his
companions had incurred the enmity of the
vindictive squatter, it was necessary that he
should go back to the time when Matt and his
family first made their appearance in Mount
Airy. He described the fight between them
and the constable and his posse, the particulars
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>of which he received from eye-witnesses;
told how Matt had stolen the canoe and six fine
fishing-rods and reels, while he and his
companions were looking for the bear they saw
on the shore of Sherwin’s Pond; and gave a
glowing account of the fight in the creek, at
which the guide laughed heartily.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I’ll jest bet that them was my taters that
you pelted him with,” said he; “’cause while I
was out in the woods with a guest from Boston,
my wife said that my garden and smoke-house
were both robbed in one night. As for them
fish poles—I think I can tell you where to find
them.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Good for you, Mr. Swan,” cried Arthur.
“Where are they?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Of course, I don’t know that they belong
to you; I only suspect it,” continued the
guide. “You see, one day last summer, Jake
Coyle brung six as purty poles as you would
want to look at up to the Sportsman’s Home,
and told Mr. Hanson, the new landlord, that he
got ’em in a boat trade. He couldn’t use ’em,
fur they wasn’t the kind that he’d been in the
habit of handlin’, and so he wanted to sell ’em.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>I told Hanson that I was as sure as any thing
could be that they had been stole, and that
mebbe the owner would come along some day
looking for them; so Hanson, he buys ’em,
reels and all, for four dollars apiece—all except
one that Jake said had been broke by a bass,
and for that he give two dollars. They were
covered with mud and rust, but I cleaned ’em
up, and now they look as good as new.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“They are our rods, and I know it,” exclaimed
Roy. “If mine is the one that’s
broken, I shall have the satisfaction of knowing
that I paid Jake for it in advance by hitting
him in the mouth with that potato.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“And if it’s mine, I settled with him this
afternoon by slapping him in the face with his
father’s paddle,” chimed in Joe Wayring.</p>

<p class='c019'>The guide laughed again. “You’re as
plucky a lot of youngsters as I ever see,” said
he, “and you may rest assured that them folks
won’t bother you or any body else much longer.
We are going to put ’em in jail for thieves when
we catch ’em.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Ah! Yes,” said Arthur; “but that’s
right where you are going to see trouble. Our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>deputy sheriff and constable searched every
inch of the ground around Sherwin’s Pond,
and all they found was the place where Matt’s
shanty once stood. He set fire to it before he
left for Indian Lake.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I know that the woods about here are tolerable
thick, and that Matt is a boss hand at
hiding,” replied the guide; “but he will find
that there’s a heap of difference between dodging
a couple of townies, and in getting away
from a lot of men who have lived in the woods
ever since they were knee high to so many
ducks. Go on, Joe. What else do you know
about Matt Coyle?”</p>

<p class='c019'>The rest of Joe’s story related solely to the
events of the evening, and it did not take him
long to describe them. When he concluded
the guide was almost as angry as he and his
chums were. The idea that that worthless
vagabond should threaten to beat such a boy as
Joe Wayring, simply because he had showed
the courage to defend himself when he was assaulted!
The guide made no remark, but there
was a look in his eye that would have made the
squatter uneasy if he had been there to see it.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>“It’s too late to do any thing to-night,” said
he, at length. “I reckon you boys have got
something good to eat in them lockers? I
thought so. Well, suppose we go ashore
and camp.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Joe and his friends readily agreed to this
proposition. They had spent five days and
nights in their boat, and they longed for a good,
sound sleep on a bed of balsam-boughs, with
the spreading branches of some friendly pine
for shelter instead of their water-proof tent.
They were not afraid to go into camp on shore
now that they had the stalwart guide for company.
Matt and his boys would not be likely
to show themselves as long as they knew that
he was with them; but the trouble was, they
didn’t know it, although they were in plain
sight when the boys built their fire on the bank,
and laid their plans to pay them a visit before
morning.</p>

  <h2 class='c011'>CHAPTER XVII. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>A BATTLE IN THE DARK.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_4_0_5 c018'>AS OUR three friends and their backwoods
companion were old campaigners, they
did not spend much time in getting ready for
the night. A roaring fire was started, the jack-lamp
hung upon a neighboring tree, and by the
aid of the light thus afforded them, Joe Wayring,
who had by this time got into a suit of dry
clothes, cleaned the fish which Arthur and Roy
had captured during his absence; Arthur
Hastings fried them and made the tea; Mr.
Swan prepared the bacon and pancakes; and
Roy cut the balsam boughs and arranged the
beds. In less than three quarters of an hour
after they drew their boats upon the beach,
they sat down to a supper that would have
tempted any healthy boy to eat, no matter
whether he was hungry or not.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Now, Mr. Swan,” said Joe, when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>dishes had been washed in the clear waters of
the pond, and the tin bucket, which contained
the supply of fish for breakfast, had been hung
up by a string so that the minks that were
sure to come around during the night could not
steal them, “tell us a story, please.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“About what?” inquired the guide, as he
filled his pipe.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh, about the first panther you ever shot.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Or about the bear you killed with a club
while he was running off with one of your
pigs,” suggested Roy.</p>

<p class='c019'>Mr. Swan was always ready. After he had
taken a few pulls at his brier-root to make
sure that it was well-started he began and told
not one story, but a dozen or more. He kept
his little audience interested until ten o’clock,
then the lamp was turned out, the fire replenished,
and the campers sought their beds of
balsam-boughs. Lulled by the rippling of the
waves upon the beach at their feet, and by the
low music of the breeze as it toyed with the
branches over their heads, their slumber was
deep and dreamless. Even the usually watchful
Jim seemed to think that there was no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>responsibility resting upon him for this particular
night, and that the mere presence of the
guide was all the protection the camp needed,
for he too slept soundly, and snored while he
slept. Consequently he did not see the uncouth
object which drew out of the darkness that
covered the surface of the pond, and slowly and
cautiously approached the camp. The object
was Matt Coyle’s scow, and in it were the
squatter and both his boys. The latter were
plying their paddles with noiseless motion, and
Matt was kneeling in the bow, waving first one
hand and then the other to show them what
course to take.</p>

<p class='c019'>It must have been long after midnight, for
there was nothing left of the fire but a glowing
bed of coals; but still there was light enough
to enable the robber to see the outlines of the
skiff, but not sufficient to show him the trim
little canoe that had been hauled out on the
bank and turned bottom side up. If he had
seen that, he would have lost no time in getting
away from so dangerous a neighborhood;
but believing that the boys were alone, and
that they had forgotten their usual caution in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>spite of the warning events of the afternoon, he
kept on until he was close enough to the skiff
to take hold of it. I saw the whole proceeding,
but of course could do nothing to arouse the
slumbering campers.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Now, turn about on your seats and give
way the best you know how,” I heard Matt
whisper to his boys. “We must pull her off
into deep water before them fellers can wake
up an’ get a holt on her.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Say, pap,” whispered Jake, in reply.
“Ain’t we goin’ ashore to give them a good larrupin’
before they make up?”</p>

<p class='c019'>If the guide had not been there, these words
would have horrified me; but as it was, I did
not feel at all uneasy. I knew very well that
Matt and his boys were no match for our party,
and that they would all be captured as surely
as they put their feet on shore; but I did not
want to see them steal that skiff. Oh, why
didn’t Jim wake up and alarm his master!</p>

<p class='c019'>“We’ll ’tend to them after we get the skiff
an’ all the nice grub an’ things that’s into it,”
said the squatter, as he tightened his grasp.
“Now be you all ready? Then give way.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>Jake and Sam laid out all their strength
upon their paddles, and the bow of the skiff
grated harshly as it moved over the sand. The
noise, slight as it was, awoke Jim, who was on
his feet in a twinkling. He took just one glance
at the marauders, and then danced about the
camp in a perfect ecstasy of rage, barking and
yelping with all his might.</p>

<p class='c019'>His first note of angry remonstrance alarmed
the boys, who were off their fragrant couches
in less time than it takes to tell it. The moment
they arose to a perpendicular, they were
wide awake and ready to act. They made a
simultaneous rush for the beach, and while
Arthur and Joe seized the skiff and pulled her
back where she belonged, in spite of all that
Jake and his brother could do to prevent it,
Roy caught up the painter and deftly took a
turn with it around a convenient sapling.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Now, haul away and see how much you
will make by it,” he exclaimed. “That’s
once you got fooled.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Wal, I’ll bet a hoss that I ain’t fooled yet,”
said the squatter, in savage tones. “Pull
ashore, Jakey, an’ we’ll get out an’ lambast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>them fellers till their own mammies won’t know
’em when they go hum. Human natur!” he
ejaculated a moment later, as the tall form of
the guide came between him and the smoldering
fire. “Who’s that? If it ain’t Swan, I’m
a Dutchman.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Come on, you miserable scoundrel,” cried
the guide, shaking his huge fist at the astonished
and thoroughly frightened robber. “I
have been looking for you, and now that I
have found you, I am going to take you back
to Indian Lake with me.”</p>

<p class='c019'>But Matt and his boys were not as anxious
to go ashore now as they had been. Without
saying a word in reply they bent to their paddles,
and made all haste to get out of sight in
the darkness.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Now, Joe,” said Mr. Swan, who never got
excited even under the most trying circumstances,
“shove off and take after them. You can
go faster than they can, so if you will get
ahead of them and keep them from reaching
the opposite shore, I will come up on this
side, and we will have them between two fires.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Joe and his companions were prompt to act
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>upon this suggestion. He and Roy pushed the
skiff into the water, and when she was fairly
afloat Arthur sprang aboard with the jack-lamp
in his hand. A moment later its strong
light flashed out over the pond, telling the fleeing
squatter in language as plain as words that
the darkness could not conceal his movements.</p>

<p class='c019'>“There they are, not more than forty yards,”
said Arthur, who stood erect on the stern
locker, steadying himself with the boathook.
“Roy, let me have that oar, and you stand
here with the lamp and open fire on them with
your potatoes.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I can’t,” was the answer. “I took the
potatoes ashore to-night and washed some for
breakfast; and the bag is in camp at this
moment.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Then we shall have to come to close quarters
with them,” said Arthur, “for I have no
idea that they will give up when they find
themselves cut off from shore.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“If we can only manage to detain them for
two minutes, we shall have all the help we
want,” Joe remarked. “Look behind you.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Arthur glanced over his shoulder, and was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>surprised to see the guide in less than a stone’s
throw of the skiff. How he had managed to
put his canoe into the water and get her under
way with so little loss of time, was a mystery.</p>

<p class='c019'>“A fellow would have to look out for Mr.
Swan in a hurry-skurry race, wouldn’t he?”
said Arthur. “Just see how he makes that
little craft of his get through the water! If
you two don’t let out a section or so of your
muscle, he will overtake the scow before we
do.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Just then Matt Coyle’s hoarse voice was
heard calling warningly to them. “Don’t
come no nigher,” it said. “If you think that
we are sich fules as to go down to Injun Lake
when we want to stay here, you are the biggest
kind of fules yourselves. I’ll break the head
of the fust one of you that comes within
reach.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Matt has crawled back to the stern of his
scow, and is standing there with his paddle in
his hand,” said Arthur, who could see every
move the robber made. “I wonder if he thinks
that we are ‘fules’ enough to give him battle
before Mr. Swan comes up to help us.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>That was just what Matt was looking for,
and he did not know what to make of it when
the skiff dashed by his scow, keeping so far
beyond reach that he could not have touched
any of her crew with his paddle if he had tried,
and deliberately placed herself across his path.
Then his eyes were opened to the details of the
plan that had been laid to entrap him, and
the promptness with which he went to work to
extricate himself was surprising. He said a
few words in a low tone to his boys, then put
his own paddle into the water, and the scow
shot ahead with greatly increased speed, never
swerving from her original course by so much
as a hair’s breadth.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Does the old villain mean to run us down,
or does he intend to come alongside and capture
us and the skiff?” said Roy, who was alarmed
as well as amazed by the squatter’s offensive
tactics. “Back water, Joe, while I give way.
It looks as though <i>we</i> had got to run now.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The scow was so close to them that they had
no time to get out of her way. They saw at a
glance that all they could reasonably hope to
accomplish was to turn their boat slightly, so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>that if the scow struck her at all, it would be a
glancing blow. But they had miscalculated
the speed of Matt’s clumsy looking craft. She
seemed to glide over the top of the water
instead of passing through it, as other boats do.
On she came with terrific force, and although
Joe and Roy worked hard to slip out of her
way, she struck the skiff fairly in the side, ripping
off two of her planks, smashing in as many
more, and making a hole that Mars could have
crawled through with all ease. At the same
instant darkness settled down over the scene as
if by magic. Arthur Hastings had been knocked
off his perch on the stern locker, and he and
the jack-lamp went into the pond together.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Whoop-ee!” yelled Matt, triumphantly.
“Will you git outen our road the next time
you see us comin’? Take that fur your imperdence
in gittin’ before your betters,” he added,
making a vicious blow with his paddle at the
place where he had last seen Joe Wayring’s
head.</p>

<p class='c019'>Joe’s head was not there now, however, for
he had been sharp enough to put it somewhere
else; but Matt was speedily made aware that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>the boy was not far away, for as the blade of
his paddle whistled harmlessly through the air,
he received a punch in the ribs with an oar that
brought from him a yell of pain, and came very
near sending him into the water. At the same
moment, a howl of agony from the unlucky
Jake announced that Roy was taking a hand in
the rumpus.</p>

<p class='c019'>The fight that followed was a very short one,
but it was warm while it lasted, and gave Matt
and his boys some idea of what a couple of
brave young fellows could do when they were
cornered. Joe, while defending himself against
the muscular squatter, managed to get in several
good blows; Roy pounded Sam to his
heart’s content, Jake having dropped out of the
contest at the very beginning of it; and Arthur
clung to the side of the skiff and called lustily
for Mr. Swan.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I’m coming,” replied the guide, who was
doing all he could to bring himself alongside
the scow. “Keep them there just a minute
longer.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Roy and Joe would have obeyed if they could;
but when Matt heard Mr. Swan’s voice sounding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>so close to him, he pushed his piratical
craft away from the skiff, and the darkness
shut him out from view. When the guide
arrived a few minutes later, he found the boys
supporting themselves by holding fast to the
sides of their boat, which was full of water.
They had relieved her of their weight just in
time to keep her from going to the bottom of
the pond. She would not sink now, for she
had no cargo aboard to speak of, and besides,
the air that was imprisoned in the lockers
assisted in keeping her afloat.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, if this don’t beat the world!”
exclaimed Mr. Swan, as soon as he had taken
in the situation. “Somehow or other those
villains always manage to come out at the top
of the heap, don’t they? Did you have a fight
with them? I heard sticks a clashing and
somebody yelling. I hope none of you ain’t
hurt.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Don’t be uneasy on that score,” replied
Roy. “Joe and I had a scrimmage with them,
but you didn’t hear either one of us yell. It
was Matt and Jake. Sam was good grit. He
never said a word, although I punched him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>with the blade of my oar the best I knew how.
Arthur was standing on one of the lockers
when the scow struck us, and he and the lamp
made a plunge of ten feet in the clear before
they touched the water.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Do you mean to say that they ran into you
a purpose?” exclaimed the guide.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Of course they did. We cut them off from
the shore, as you directed, and that old scow
of theirs came at us like a battering-ram. Matt
heard Joe tell us to-night to sink the canoe,
and that was what put it into his head to run
into us.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Meanwhile Arthur Hastings had worked his
way around to the bow of the skiff and secured
the painter, one end of which he made fast to
a ring in the stern of the canoe. The chase
was over, of course. They could not continue
the pursuit in the dark, for the squatter could
easily elude them in a hundred different ways,
and neither would it be prudent to follow him
in the canoe. The little craft was intended to
carry only one person, with a very limited
allowance of camp equipage, and the added
weight of one of the boys would have sunk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>her so deep in the water that no speed could
be got out of her. The only thing they could
do was to go back to camp and finish their
sleep.</p>

<p class='c019'>“But what shall we do to-morrow?” was
the question that Joe and his comrades asked
themselves and one another. “Our boat is
badly stove, and if we can’t patch her up, how
are we going to get back to Mount Airy?”</p>

<p class='c019'>Mr. Swan towed the disabled skiff to the
shore, her crew swimming alongside or trying
to assist him by pushing behind, and the fire
was started up again to aid them in making an
examination of the injuries she had received.
They were fully as severe as the boys expected
to find them, and it was a wonder to them that
she was so long in filling.</p>

<p class='c019'>“There’s plenty of guides down to the lake
that can fix her up for you in good shape,”
said Mr. Swan.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Of course,” replied Roy. “But the lake
is twenty-five miles from here, and there’s no
way to get her down there.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Mebbe there is,” answered the guide.
“For a shilling I’ll agree that she shall go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>down there, and carry you into the bargain.
But we can’t do nothing with her to-night.
You boys get on some dry clothes and go to
bed again.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Joe and his companions were quite willing to
act upon this suggestion, but they were in no
hurry to go to sleep. Neither was Mr. Swan.
They sat around the fire for a long time, talking
over the incidents of their battle in the dark,
and as I listened closely, I have been able to give
you the story in the same way that it was told to
Mr. Swan. The squatter’s extraordinary luck
and the skill he exhibited in eluding arrest
seemed to astonish them all. How I longed
for the power of speech so that I could tell
them that robbing camps and smoke-houses
was not the only business to which Matt Coyle
intended to devote himself, now that the offer
of his service as guide and boatman had been
declined by the managers of the Indian Lake
hotels. But they found it out for themselves,
and before long, too.</p>

<p class='c019'>It was three o’clock before the campers again
sought their blankets. The boys slept much
later than usual, but the guide was stirring at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>the first peep of day. He piled fresh fuel on
the fire, put Roy’s potatoes into the ashes to
roast, made the coffee and pancakes, and took
time while the fish were frying to give the skiff
another good looking over. Then he picked
up Joe’s camp ax, and disappeared among
the trees, returning a few minutes later with
several large slabs of birch bark. By this time
the fish were done, and the guide announced
the fact by calling out—</p>

<p class='c019'>“Tumble up, you sleepy heads. You’ve
just two seconds in which to take a dip in the
pond and get ready for breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Having had as many “dips” as they wanted
already, the boys contented themselves with
washing their hands and faces; after which
they sat down to their homely breakfast with
appetites to which the dwellers in towns and
cities are, for the most part, strangers. Of
course the squatter was still uppermost in their
minds, and he and his exploits formed the
principal topic of their conversation.</p>

<p class='c019'>“By the way, Mr. Swan, you forgot to tell
us what Matt stole at those camps,” said
Arthur, suddenly.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>“Did I? Well, in my camp he took a Lefever
hammerless that cost the owner three hundred
dollars; and from a gentleman who had Bob
Martin for a guide, he stole a Winchester
worth fifty dollars. Not satisfied with that,
he took every thing in the shape of grub that
he could lay his hands on, and me and my
employer had to live on trout while we were
making a journey of more than a hundred and
fifty miles. Trout’s good enough once in a
while; but I swan to man, if I want it for a
steady diet. Bob Martin said he eat so much
of that kind of food that he wanted to snap at
every fly that came near him.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Matt and his family are always on the look-out
for grub, and I should think that the
sharp edge would be taken off their appetites
after a while,” Arthur remarked. “Did you
try to follow his trail?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Bless you, no. There ain’t a country in
Ameriky that is so well provided with water
courses as this Indian Lake country is, and
what’s the use of trying to follow the trail of a
boat? You might as well think of tracking a
bird through the air.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>“What do you suppose Matt intends to do
with those guns?” inquired Roy. “Of course
he wouldn’t be so foolish as to offer them for
sale around here, and they certainly will be of
no use to him unless he took a big supply of
cartridges at the same time he took the
weapons.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I’ve got my own idea about that,” replied
the guide. “It’s only an idea, mind you, but
I have good reason for holding to it. A year
ago last spring, Matt got to acting just as he’s
acting now, because the hotels wouldn’t send
him out with their guests, and me and the rest
of the guides tracked him down, and told him
that he’d got to clear himself. He allowed he
wouldn’t do it, and that he’d make it hot for
the fellers that tried to make him go, so we
went to work and burned up everything he had,
except his clothes and we’pons. Then he had
to dig out; but before he went, he sent us
word that if he couldn’t do guiding for
the hotels none of us should, for the reason
that there wouldn’t be nobody to hire us.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“What did he mean by that?” exclaimed
Joe.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>“You’re pretty sharp fellows,” said the
guide, in reply. “What’s your opinion of his
meaning?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“He doesn’t intend to kill off the guests as
fast as they arrive, does he?” said Arthur.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Probably not,” said Joe. “But he means to
steal them poor, and bother them in every way
he can, so that they won’t come here to spend
their summer vacations.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“That’s the very idea,” said the guide, approvingly.
“That’s what he was up to, and
that’s what he is trying to do now; but we
ain’t going to let him stay. Now, then,” he
added, as he arose to his feet and produced his
ancient brier-root, “if one of you will help me
while the others tend to things about the camp,
we’ll be on our way to the lake in less’n half
an hour by Joe’s Waterbury.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Are you going with us?” asked Arthur,
who was delighted at the prospect of spending
the day, and perhaps another night in the company
of so famous a story teller.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I reckon I might as well,” replied the
guide. “I know where to find Matt’s trail
now, but I can’t do nothing with him and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>family all by myself, so I will go back and get
some of the boys to help me.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, see here, Mr. Swan,” said Joe. “If
you have to burn him out again, don’t forget to
save my canoe from the general destruction.
I know it isn’t a very valuable thing, having
seen its best days long ago, but still I shouldn’t
like to think that I had lost it for good.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I’ll bear it in mind,” said the guide.
“Now, don’t let the fire go out. We shall
need it to toast the bark.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“What do you want to toast the bark for?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why, to make it straighten out and stay
somewhere. Don’t you see how it curls up in
all sorts of ways? Summer bark isn’t as
good as winter bark for this sort of work, but
I reckon we can make it keep the water out of
the skiff till we get to the lake.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Arthur and Joe made all haste to wash the
breakfast dishes and collect their “duffle”, so
that there would be no delay in loading the
skiff when the repairs were completed, and then
sat down to keep the fire going, and to watch
the guide, in whose proceedings they were
much interested. They wanted to learn how it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>was done, so that they might know what to do
in case a similar misfortune befell them when
there was no accommodating backwoodsman
near to help them. Fortunately they never
went into the woods without taking with them
some strips of canvas, a supply of tallow and
rosin, and a paper of copper tacks. By the aid
of the tacks, the birch bark, after it had been
toasted over the fire so that it would “stay
somewhere”, was fastened upon the gaping
wound which the sharp corner of Matt’s scow
had made in her side, the seams were thickly
coated with melted rosin and tallow, then the
canvas was tacked on, and Mr. Swan declared
that his task was finished.</p>

<p class='c019'>“She’ll leak a little water, of course,” said
he, as he filled up for another smoke, “but not
much after the bark has a chance to swell a
trifle. Now I reckon we are ready to be
off.”</p>

<p class='c019'>It was the work of but a few minutes to pack
the provisions and cooking utensils away in
the lockers, and as soon as that had been done,
the boys shoved the skiff into the water and
followed Mr. Swan, whose canoe was moving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>toward the creek which connected the pond
with Indian Lake. The boat didn’t leak as
much as they thought it would. Five minutes’
bailing every half hour kept her comparatively
dry.</p>

<p class='c019'>The boys camped that night within less than
five miles of the lake, and of course had the pleasure
of listening to more of the guide’s stories.
They made an early start the next morning,
Mr. Swan being impatient to obtain assistance
and resume the pursuit of the man who had
despoiled the camp of his employer, and at
seven o’clock the two boats were run up on the
beach in front of the Sportsman’s Home.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>
  <h2 class='c011'>CHAPTER XVIII. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_5 c018'>MR. SWAN and his young friends at once
went ashore and set out for the
hotel, the former to tell “the boys” that he
had struck the trail of the man they most
wanted to see, and Joe and his companions to
examine the rods the landlord had in his possession,
and to engage some one who was handy
with tools to repair the skiff. They left me
lying in my usual place on the stern locker,
with Jim and the two bait-rods for company.</p>

<p class='c019'>I had heard so much about Indian Lake and
its hotels that I had pictured them out to myself,
and thought I could tell pretty near how
they looked; but nevertheless I was greatly
surprised by what I saw around me. I told
myself that the boy who could not find there
what he wanted in the way of recreation, must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>be hard to suit. If he was fond of gay company
and liked such places as Saratoga and
Long Branch, he would probably stop at the
“American” on the further side of the lake;
but if he were an angler and a lover of nature,
or if he desired to get away somewhere and
rest, he would choose the “Sportsman’s Home”
every time.</p>

<p class='c019'>The house itself looked like a hunter’s camp
on a grand scale, or like the cabins of the
loggers I afterward saw in the wilds of Maine,
only it had two stories instead of one. It was
built entirely of logs, which had been painted
with some substance that I don’t know the
name of, but it sparkled in the bright sunlight
like a covering of ice. In the groves that surrounded
the hotel on all sides, were log houses,
tents and shanties without number. Noisy
children were running in and out among the
trees, the clashing of croquet balls was almost
incessant, sportsmen in dogskin jackets, leather
helmets and leggings, and guides in blue shirts
and cowhide boots were constantly going and
coming, and every one that I saw seemed to be
enjoying himself. This was one of the happy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>parties that Matt Coyle was determined to
break up because the landlords refused to trust
their guests to his care! It was no wonder
Mr. Swan and his brother guides were anxious
to rid the country of the presence of such a
villain. While I was thinking about it I heard
myself addressed in a faint voice; and upon
looking in the direction from which it came, I
discovered a seedy breech-loader resting
against the thwart of the neighboring canoe.</p>

<p class='c019'>“You don’t seem to remember me,” said he,
reproachfully.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I can’t say that I do,” was my reply.
“I think you have made a mistake in the fly-rod.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“No, I haven’t,” said he, confidently. “I
knew you before you left Mr. Brown’s store.
Don’t you remember the English fowling-piece
that had the dispute with that conceited
bamboo?”</p>

<p class='c019'>So this was my old acquaintance, the
“Brummagem shooting-iron,” was it? It was
right on the point of my tongue to remind him
that the bamboo had not showed himself to be
any more conceited than he was; but I didn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>say it. I judged by his appearance that he had
seen pretty hard times since he left Mr. Brown’s
protecting care. He had sneeringly told me
that I was not worth the modest price that had
been set upon me, but, here I was, as bright as
ever, while he looked as though he had been
through half a dozen wars.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I remember you now,” said I, “but you
have changed so much that I did not recognize
you at first. Where have you been, and what
have you done since that countryman of yours
ordered you to be sent up to the Lambert
House?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“He was no countryman of mine,” replied
the double barrel, sadly. “He was a full-fledged
Yankee who tried to pass himself off
for something better than he really was. But
he’s got all over that; the guides laughed him
out of it.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Did they laugh you into your present condition?”
I asked, remembering that the
double barrel had also tried to pass himself
off for something better than he really
was.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Eh? No,” he replied, indignantly. “It’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>the result of abuse and hardship. Last year I
was stolen out of camp—”</p>

<p class='c019'>“By whom?” I interrupted, excitedly.</p>

<p class='c019'>“By a vagabond who calls himself Matt
Coyle,” was the reply. “His old shanty leaked
like a sieve, and I got wet and rusty. That’s
what makes me look so bad.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“How did your master get you back?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I heard the story about in this way: In
less than an hour after I was stolen, a dirty,
unkempt boy made his appearance in my
master’s camp, and told him that he had been
fishing on the pond all the afternoon, that he
knew the man who took me, and for a reward
of ten dollars he would follow me up and steal
me back again.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Of course your master wasn’t deceived by
any such shallow trick as that!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, he was. You see, he and the two
young fellows who come up here with him
every summer, never hire a guide. As they
seldom venture more than twenty or thirty
miles away from the lake, and never leave the
water courses, there’s really no need of a guide;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>but if they had had one when that boy came
into camp, he would have saved my master
from imposition. As it was, he promised to
give him the ten dollars, and before sunset I
was brought back. But it had rained buckets
during my absence, I was wet inside and out,
my master did not know enough to take care of
me, and that’s how I came to be in this fix.
They’re coming now, and we are off again, I
suppose.”</p>

<p class='c019'>I looked toward the hotel, and there was the
young man with the gold eye-glasses, peaked
shoes and downy upper lip—the same knowing
fellow, who had been foolish enough to take a
cheap gun that wasn’t warranted, with the
expectation that it would do as good work as a
Greener.</p>

<p class='c019'>“We’re going up to the pond, and I shall be
called upon to fire heavier charges than I can
stand at every thing in the shape of a partridge
or squirrel that comes in my way,” added the
double barrel.</p>

<p class='c019'>“You ought not to be required to shoot those
birds at this time of year,” said I. “It’s
against the law.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>“Oh, I don’t hurt them any. I only shoot
at them. I never killed any thing.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“That’s just what Mr. Brown said when he
sold you,” thought I. “Have you a dog to
guard your camp? Well, you ought to have.
Matt Coyle lives up there, and night before
last he made a daring attempt to steal this
skiff, and then he tried to sink her. Don’t you
see the hole in her side?”</p>

<p class='c019'>I was going on to tell the double barrel that
if his master did not keep his eyes open he
might expect another visit from the squatter,
but just then I saw Joe Wayring and his
friends coming down the bank; and as I was
more interested in them and the rods they carried
on their shoulders, than I was in the fortunes
of the seedy-looking fowling piece, I had
nothing more to say to him. I saw him once
afterward, and then he was a perfect wreck of
a gun. There wasn’t enough of him left to sell
for old iron.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Haw! haw!” said Roy, as he jumped into
the skiff. “We’ve got them back again, and
only one of them is the worse for being stolen
by that squatter.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>I wondered which one that was, and found
out when Arthur Hastings began taking his
rod from its case. It was a beautiful rod, and
looked strong enough to handle any fish that
was likely to be encountered in that country;
but the second joint was broken close to the
ferrule. I looked pityingly at him, little
dreaming that I was destined to go home in the
same crippled condition.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I don’t believe that any bass that ever
wiggled a fin could break that rod,” said
Arthur, dolefully. “Matt or some of his
vagabond band must have caught the hook
into a log or the stem of a lily-pad. Well, it
isn’t as bad as it might be, but I hate to think
that that squatter has made some money out
of me.”</p>

<p class='c019'>While the boys were waiting for the guide
who had promised to come down and look at
the skiff, they talked of their interview with
the landlord of the Sportsman’s Home, and in
that way I came to know just what happened
when they went up to see the rods he had purchased
of Jake Coyle. Of course they recognized
them at once, and promptly handed over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>the money that Mr. Hanson had paid for their
property, but said nothing about paying for
the rods that belonged to Tom Bigden and his
cousins.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Hadn’t you better take them all?” asked
the landlord. “You say that the boys from
whom these rods were stolen live in Mount
Airy, and perhaps they would be grateful to
you for returning them.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I think we’d better not have any thing to
do with them,” said Arthur. “But we’ll forward
them a dispatch and let them send or
come after the rods. They’ve nothing else
to do.”</p>

<p class='c019'>There was telegraphic communication between
Indian Lake and Mount Airy, by the way of
New London, and Arthur wrote and sent off
the dispatch before he left the hotel. If he
and his chums had been able to look far enough
into the future to see every thing that was to
result from this simple act, they would have
been greatly astonished. I know I was when I
heard the full particulars.</p>

<p class='c019'>In a few minutes the expected guide came
down to the beach and gave the skiff a careful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>examination. After he had stripped off the
canvas and bark, so that he could see the full
extent of her injuries, he remarked that Matt’s
scow must have hit her a middling heavy crack.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I should say she did,” replied Joe, with a
laugh. “When three strong fellows do their
level best with paddles, they can make a small
boat get through the water with considerable
speed. They hit us hard enough to knock
Arthur overboard. Who are those men, and
where are they going in such haste?” he continued,
directing the guide’s attention to a
company of guests and boatmen who were
walking rapidly toward the beach.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Two of them are the gentlemen whose
camps were robbed the other day,” replied the
guide, after he had taken a glance at the party.
“They’ve got some friends to help them, and
are going out to see if they can track down
them varmints who have been kicking up so
much fuss about here of late. There comes
Swan. He’s going with them, but they might
as well stay at home, the whole of them. That
Matt Coyle can cover up his trail like an Injun.
It took every guide in the country to hunt him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>down the last time we drove him away from
here.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“You missed it by not putting him in jail,”
said Roy.</p>

<p class='c019'>“That’s just what we wanted to do,”
answered the guide. “But when we come to
talk to some of the guests about it—there was
lawyers among them, you know—we found that
we didn’t have any evidence that would convict
him. We suspected him, but we could not
prove any thing.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“You’ll not be troubled in that way this
time,” Arthur remarked. “You’ll have the
guns for evidence.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Don’t fool yourself,” said the guide. “Do
you suppose that they will find that three
hundred dollar scatter-gun and that fifty dollar
rifle when they find Matt Coyle—that is, if
they do find him? Not by a great sight. Them
things is safe hid in the woods. Matt’ll sw’ar
that he didn’t hook ’em, and there ain’t a
living man that can sw’ar that he did. The
only thing they can do is to burn him out of
house and home, like we did last time, and force
him to go off somewhere and steal a new outfit.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>“What’s the reason we can’t go with them?”
said Joe, suddenly.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I reckon you can. You know more about
the woods than some of that party do, and you
might be of some use to them.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, look here, Mr. Morris: Will you fix
up our boat in good shape, give her a coat or
two of paint and take care of the things that
we shall be obliged to leave behind us?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I will, sartain,” answered the guide, readily.</p>

<p class='c019'>In an instant both the lockers were opened,
and Joe Wayring, snatching up a camp basket,
started post-haste for the hotel to hire a skiff
and purchase a small supply of provisions for
the trip, leaving Roy and Arthur to select the
outfit. The tent and the most of their heavy
cooking-utensils were to be left behind. They
were very useful articles, of course, but they
were not absolutely necessary to their existence,
or even to their comfort. Besides, the skiff
that would be provided for them would not
carry as much “duffle” as the roomy boat
they were going to leave in the guide’s keeping.
Their bows and arrows, blankets, the
knapsacks that contained their extra clothing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>and the frying pan must go, of course; but
every thing else was left behind.</p>

<p class='c019'>While they were awaiting Joe’s return, Mr.
Swan and his party came up, got into their
boats and pushed away from the beach. Mr.
Morris pointed out two stalwart gentlemen in
shooting costume, who, he said, were the
owners of the stolen guns. They seemed to be
in very bad humor, and the boys did not wonder
at it.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I shouldn’t like to be in Matt’s place if
those men get their hands on him,” said Roy,
in a low tone.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Nor I,” answered the guide. “They sw’ar
they’ll pound him before he goes to jail, and
they look to me like fellers that will keep
their word.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Say, boys,” exclaimed Mr. Swan, as he
backed water with his oars and brought his
boat to a stand-still at the stern of the skiff,
“can’t you stay here till we come back? We
want your evidence.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“We’ll be around, you may depend upon
that,” returned Roy. “But we’re not going
to stay here, if you will let us take part in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>the hunt. Joe has gone up to the hotel after
a boat.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Oh! All right,” said Mr. Swan. “Them’s
two of the lads that had the battle in the dark
that I was telling you about,” he added,
addressing himself to the owner of the lost
“scatter-gun”, who was his employer.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, I must say that they are plucky
fellows, and that they deserve better luck,”
said the gentleman, returning the military
salute which the boys gave him from sheer
force of habit. “I hope their skiff can be
easily repaired, Mr. Morris?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“No trouble about that, sir,” answered the
guide. “She’ll be right and tight before sundown—all
except the paint.”</p>

<p class='c019'>After telling Roy and his companion that if
they did not overtake him before, they would
find him encamped somewhere on the bank of
the creek near the pond, Mr. Swan applied
himself to his oars, and a fleet of seven boats,
manned by fourteen angry and determined
guides and guests, set out in pursuit of Matt
Coyle and his thieving crew. Ten minutes
later Joe Wayring returned, accompanied by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>a guide and a small party of ladies and gentlemen.
The former was to show him what boat
he could take, and the latter were listening
with much interest to Joe’s graphic account
of his adventures with the squatter. Joe was
surprised to learn that Matt’s way of creeping
up through the bushes and robbing unguarded
camps, had frightened the women and children
so badly that they refused to go into the
woods until the thief had been captured and
safely lodged in jail. That depended upon
the evidence Joe could give to put him there.</p>

<p class='c019'>“That’s all mighty fine,” said Mr. Morris,
after listening to what Joe had to say of his
conversation with the stranger, “but they
don’t give a thought to the hardest part of the
business. Matt ain’t caught yet, and there’ll
have to be a heap of hard work done before he
is shut up so’t he can’t steal no more scatter-guns;
you see if there ain’t. I’d like to take
a hand in the hunt myself, but I’ve got to go
out with the same man I guided for last year,
and he’s liable to come along any day.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Their boat having been pointed out to them,
Joe and his companions lost no time in putting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>their effects aboard of it. Then they bade Mr.
Morris good-by, lifted their caps to the party
on shore, and rowed down the lake and up the
creek in pursuit of the fleet. They overtook Mr.
Swan and his party just before they landed to eat
their lunch, traveled in company with them during
the rest of the day, and went into camp with
them at night. I had abundant opportunity
to compare notes with the three recovered bait-rods,
who corroborated the story that was told
me by the canvas canoe, and which I
have already given to the reader in my
own words. The squatter was fully resolved,
they said, that if he couldn’t act as guide in
those woods, nobody should; and the worst of
it was, he seemed to be in a fair way to accomplish
his object. The sportsmen who patronized
the hotels came there for fun and recreation;
and it wasn’t likely that they could see
much of it if their wives and children were to
be prevented from accompanying them on their
fishing excursions through fear of this man,
Matt Coyle. The owners of the Lefever hammerless
and Winchester rifle didn’t see much
fun in having their fine weapons stolen, and if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>these depredations were not stopped, and that
speedily, it would not be long before the guests
would be looking for some place of resort where
thieves were not quite so plenty.</p>

<p class='c019'>“But even that isn’t the worst of it,” continued
Joe’s bait-rod, who did the most of the
talking. “Every thing seems to indicate that
the squatter is going to have a bigger following
now than he has been able to boast of in the past.
He isn’t the only worthless scamp there is in
the woods, by any means. You know, I suppose,
that the State fish commissioners have
established a hatchery at the outlet of Deer
Lake, a few miles from here?”</p>

<p class='c019'>I replied that I had not heard of it.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, they have, and the superintendent
wants to prohibit fishing there, so that he can
get a supply of eggs large enough to stock all
these waters, which will soon be stripped of
trout unless there are some put in to take the
place of the multitudes that are caught every
year. The superintendent sets traps in the
outlet to catch the fish so that he can get their
eggs, and three or four fellows who live right
there, and who look enough like Matt Coyle to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>be his brothers, go to the outlet every night
and cut the nets. The superintendent threatened
to have them arrested if they didn’t quit
it, and they told him that they had always
fished in that outlet, and if he wanted the
hatchery buildings to stay there, he hadn’t better
try to stop them. I heard the whole conversation.
I was down there when old Dead
Shot was broken.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Who’s Dead Shot?” I inquired.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I am,” faintly replied Arthur Hastings’s
crippled rod.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why, that’s a queer name for you to bear,”
said I. “I think it would be more appropriate
for a shot-gun or rifle.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Perhaps it would; but Arthur has always
called me that since I caught his first string of
yellow pike for him, and it is the name I go by.
I never let a fish get away when I get a good
grip on him—that is, when I have some one to
handle me who knows what he is about. But
Jake don’t know any thing about a rod, for he
has always fished with a pole he cut in the
bushes. On the day the superintendent talked
so plainly to the vagabonds who cut his nets,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>Jake was fishing in the outlet, and Matt was
hiding in one of the cabins. A little fish—I
should not think he weighed more than a
pound, judging by the bite he gave—took the
hook, which was baited with worms, and Jake
tried to yank him out by main strength, as he
had always been in the habit of doing; but the
line caught between two rocks, and as Jake
threw back his head and surged on me with all
the muscle he had, I broke. That’s all there
was of it.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“And do you think that Matt Coyle will
strike hands with those fellows at the outlet?”
I asked, when Dead Shot had ended
his story.</p>

<p class='c019'>“He has done it already, and our friends
here have undertaken a bigger job than they
bargained for,” answered the bait-rod. “Those
vagabonds are all tarred with the same stick.
They sympathize with Matt, and will hide him
in their houses and help him in every way
they can.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Haven’t we got force enough to go into the
houses and take him out?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“We’ve got the force, but not the authority.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>There’s not an officer or a search-warrant in our
party.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Not being posted in law, I did not quite understand
the situation, but I didn’t like to ask
any more questions. It was enough for me to
know that Matt Coyle seemed to have the best
of the game. Indeed, he always seemed to
have it.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c011'>CHAPTER XIX. <br /> <br /><span class='small'>CONCLUSION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_5 c018'>THE boats made an early start the next
morning, and reached the pond at nine
o’clock. Half an hour later they had crossed
it, and were moving up the creek where I performed
my first exploit, and Joe Wayring so
narrowly escaped capture by Matt Coyle and his
boys. It annoyed me to think that the squatter
and his family had enjoyed so good a supper,
and that I had unwittingly provided it for
them. It would not have soothed my feelings
much if some one had told me that, although
that was the first meal I had caught for them,
it would not be the last.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Now, then,” said Mr. Swan, after he and
his party had listened to Joe’s description of the
exciting incidents that happened in the creek
on the evening of the previous day, “we will
divide ourselves into two fleets and take
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>opposite sides of the stream. As we go up,
let every one of us keep a bright lookout for a
sign. Those robbers could not have got into
their scow or landed from it without leaving a
trail, and that is what we want to find.”</p>

<p class='c019'>In obedience to these instructions four of the
boats kept to one side of the creek, the remaining
four pulled over to the other bank, and the
hunt began in earnest. Every inch of the shore
on both sides was closely scrutinized, but up
to three o’clock in the afternoon nothing suspicious
had been discovered. Mr. Swan began
to believe that they had passed the trail long
ago without seeing it, and said as much to his
employer, adding—</p>

<p class='c019'>“That villain is sharper than two or three
men have any business to be. He and his
family, the old woman included, can go
through the woods without leaving trail enough
for a hound to follow. They never forget to
be as careful as they know how, for they have
so long lived in constant fear of arrest that—”</p>

<p class='c019'>The guide suddenly paused, and looked
earnestly at Joe and his companions, whose
actions seemed to indicate that they had found
<span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>something that would bear looking into.
Their boat was loitering along two or three
rods behind the others, Roy and Arthur doing
the rowing, while Joe was stretched out flat on
the knapsacks, his chin resting on his arms
which were supported by the gunwale, and his
eyes fastened upon the bank. All at once he
started up and said, in a low tone:</p>

<p class='c019'>“Cease rowing. Look at that.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Look at what?” demanded Roy, after he
and Arthur had run their eyes up and down
the bank without seeing any thing that was
calculated to excite astonishment. “At those
bushes growing in the water? That’s nothing,
for we’ve seen bushes growing in the water
ever since we came into the creek.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I am aware of it; but if you will look
closely at these particular bushes, you will see
that the bark is scraped off some of them, and
that they all lean away from the creek as if
some heavy body had been dragged over them,”
answered Joe. “Back port and give way starboard.
Let’s turn in here; and if we don’t
find something or other on the opposite side, I
shall wonder.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>The rowers obeyed, without much confidence
as to the result, it must be confessed, and
when Mr. Swan and his party arrived, having
all turned back to see what it was that had
attracted the attention of the boys, neither they
nor their boat were in sight. There was something
on the bank, however, that instantly
caught the sharp eye of one of the guides, who
at once proceeded to take himself to task in a
way that would have excited his ire if any one
else had done it.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Hit me over the head with a paddle, somebody,”
said he. “I’m going to throw up my
position when I get back to the lake, and quit
guiding. I ain’t no good any more. I come
along here not ten minutes ago, and didn’t see
what them boys saw at once. Look at them
bushes, and then look at that,” he added, pulling
his boat closer to the bank, and placing
the blade of his oar in a little depression in the
edge of the water. “Matt Coyle shoved that
scow of his’n over them bushes, and that’s
what barked them and made them bend over
that way. He suspicioned that some of us
would see it, so he come back and stood right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>there where my oar is, and tried to straighten
the bushes up with a pole or something.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“That’s so,” said Mr. Swan, to his employer,
“Didn’t I tell you that he was a sharp one?
The tricks that that fellow don’t know ain’t
worth knowing.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Just then a twig snapped on the bank and
Joe Wayring came into view. “Don’t talk so
loud,” he whispered, as he held up his finger
warningly. “Matt’s scow isn’t twenty feet
from here, and that’s all the proof I want that
his camp is close at land.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Instantly seven pairs of oars were dropped
into the water, and as many boats were forced
through the bushes and into the little bay on
the other side. There lay the piratical craft
which had done her best to send the skiff to
the bottom of the pond, but nothing was to be
seen or heard of her crew.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Keep still, every body,” cautioned Mr.
Swan, in the lowest possible whisper. “They’re
out there in the woods, but remember that they
ain’t caught yet, and that they won’t be if their
ears tell them that we’re coming.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Joe afterward said that the trail that led
<span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>from the scow into the bushes was so plain that
a blind man could have followed it; so it
seemed that, for once, Matt had forgotten to
be careful. No doubt he thought that the bay
in which his scow found a resting-place, was so
effectually hidden by the bushes in front of it,
that it would never be discovered by a pursuing
party. We have seen that he had good reason
for this belief. If Joe and his chums had
decided to remain at the lake and enjoy themselves
there while their skiff was being repaired,
instead of joining their forces with Mr. Swan’s
hunting party, it is probable that the squatter’s
retreat never would have been discovered; and
neither would the pursuers—well, I’ll wait
until I get to that before I tell about it.</p>

<p class='c019'>Mr. Swan, who was the acknowledged leader
of the party, at once shouldered his rifle and
began following up the trail, the others falling
in in single file behind him. They moved so
silently that I could not hear a leaf rustle; and
I told myself that the surprise and capture of
the squatter and his whole shiftless tribe was a
foregone conclusion. I afterward learned that
Mr. Swan and the guides who were with him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>thought so too. Before they had gone fifty
yards, the former suddenly stopped and whispered
to the man next behind him—</p>

<p class='c019'>“We are close upon them. I smell smoke.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“And I smell coffee,” replied the man to
whom the words were addressed, and who
sniffed the air as if he were trying to locate the
camp by the aid of his nose instead of his eyes,
“and bacon.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Shaking his hand warningly at the men
behind him, the guide moved forward again
with long, noiseless strides. Presently he discovered
a thin blue cloud of smoke rising above
the bushes close in front of him. He looked at
it a moment, and then dashed ahead at the top
of his speed, his eager companions following at
his heels.</p>

<p class='c019'>A few hasty steps brought them to the little
cleared spot in a thicket of evergreens in which
Matt Coyle had made his camp. On one side
of it was a lean-to with a roof of boughs, and
on the other was the fire, with a battered
coffee pot simmering and sputtering beside it.
Scattered about over the ground were several
slices of half-fried bacon, which had been hurriedly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>dumped from the pan. A few broken
plates and dishes that stood on a log close at
hand, bore silent testimony to the fact that the
squatter’s wife was just getting ready to lay
the table, when news was brought to the camp
that Mr. Swan and his party were coming.
Under the lean-to were some worthless articles
in the way of wearing apparel and bed-clothes,
but every thing of value had disappeared.
There was nothing like a hammerless shot gun
or a Winchester rifle to be found.</p>

<p class='c019'>“The nest is warm, but where are the birds?”
exclaimed Mr. Swan’s employer, who had
jumped into the clearing with his coat off and
his fists doubled up, all ready to carry out his
threat of pounding Matt Coyle before he was
sent to jail.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Didn’t I say that they were sharp?”
replied the guide. “The birds have took
wing.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Then take to your heels and catch them,”
exclaimed his employer. “Can’t you follow
a trail? They can’t have been gone more than
five minutes. A hundred dollars to the man
that will capture that villain for me.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>“And I will add a hundred to it,” cried the
owner of the stolen Winchester.</p>

<p class='c019'>The guides did not need these extra inducements,
for they had more at stake than these
two strangers who spent two months out of
every twelve in the woods, and the rest of the
year in the city, following some lucrative business
or profession. The guides’ bread and
butter depended upon their exertions, and they
were no whit more anxious to effect Matt’s
capture now, than they were before the two
hundred dollars reward had been offered them.
At a word from Mr. Swan they separated and
began circling around the lean-to to find the
trail; but this did not take up two minutes of
their time. They found five trails; and a
short examination of them showed that they
all led away in different directions.</p>

<p class='c019'>“That trick is borrowed from the plains
Indians,” said Joe, when Mr. Swan announced
this fact to his employer. “Whenever the
hostiles find themselves hard pressed by the
troops, they break up into little bands, and
start off toward different points of the compass;
but before they separate, they take care
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>to have it understood where they shall come
together again.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“That’s a fact,” assented the owner of the
Winchester. “I have been among those copper-colored
gentlemen, when I had nothing to
depend on except the speed of my pony; but
how does it come that you are so well posted?
Have you ever hunted on the plains?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“No, sir; but I have the promise that I shall
some day enjoy that pleasure,” answered Joe.
“My uncle told me about it. He’s been there
often. Now the question in my mind is: Did
Matt, before his family scattered like so many
quails, appoint a place of meeting? If he did,
that’s where we ought to go.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Young man, you are a sharp one,” said
the gentleman, admiringly. “What do you
say, Swan?”</p>

<p class='c019'>The guide appealed to could not say any
thing, and neither could the others. Unfortunately
they did not know that the squatter had
made friends with the vagabonds living in the
vicinity of the State hatchery. If they had
known it, that was the place they would have
started for without loss of time, but they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>wouldn’t have caught him if they had gone
there.</p>

<p class='c019'>“There’s a good deal of hard sense in Joe’s
head,” said Mr. Swan, after a short pause.
“Of course, Matt and his family will come
together again somewhere, but you see the
trouble is, we don’t know what point they are
striking for.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Can’t you follow the trails and find out?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Take the plainest one of them trails, and
I’ll bet every thing I’ve got that you can’t
follow it a hundred yards,” said Mr. Swan.
“It is going to take us a good long month to
hunt them down, and we’ll be lucky if we do
it in that time.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“But we can’t wait so long,” protested one
of the guests. “We must return to the city
to-morrow. Our business demands our attention.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The guides consulted in low tones, and so
did their employers. Finally one of the latter
wrote something on a card and handed it to
Mr. Swan, saying:</p>

<p class='c019'>“If we have done all we can, we might as
well go back to the hotel; but before we start,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>we make you this offer: We will give a hundred
dollars apiece to the man who will find our
weapons, capture the thief and hold him so that
we can come and testify against him. Or, we
will give fifty dollars apiece for the guns without
the thief, and the same amounts for the
thief without the guns. Boys, you are included
in that offer.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Thank you, sir,” said Arthur. “It would
afford us great satisfaction if we could be the
means of restoring your property to you.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Before we leave here we’ll fix things so that
Matt won’t find much to comfort him if he
should accidentally circle around this way
after we are gone,” said Mr. Swan. “Pile on
every thing, boys.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The “boys” understood him and went to
work with a will. In less time than it takes to
tell it, the lean-to was pulled down and thrown
upon the fire, the bed-clothes and dishes were
piled on top, the bacon was driven so deeply
into the ground by the heels of heavy boots
that a hungry hound could hardly have scented
it—in short, every thing that Matt and his
family had left behind in their hurried flight,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>was utterly destroyed. His scow was not forgotten.
They would knock it out of all semblance
to a boat when they went back to the
creek.</p>

<p class='c019'>Having started a roaring fire, they were
obliged to stay and see it burn itself out, for
they dared not leave it for fear that it might
set the woods aflame. So they stood around
and saw it blaze, grumbling the while over
the ill luck that had attended their efforts to
capture the cunning squatter, and it was fully
three-quarters of an hour before Mr. Swan
thought it safe to return to the boats. This
delay gave Matt Coyle plenty of time in which
to carry out a very neat piece of villainy, some
of which I saw, and all of which I heard.</p>

<p class='c019'>While the scenes I have just described were
being enacted in the clearing, there were lively
times in the little bay of which I have spoken. You
know we were left in company with Matt’s
scow, the boat in which I rode being drawn
up on the bank on one side of him and Mr.
Swan’s on the other; and no sooner had the
hunting party disappeared in the bushes, than
we began reviling him the best we knew how.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>The only reason we didn’t break him into
kindling wood at once, was because we couldn’t.
Our will was good enough.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Get away from here,” said <i>Wanderer</i>.
(That was the name of Mr. Swan’s boat. He
had always lived and worked in the company
of gentlemen, and he did not like to occupy
close quarters with so disreputable a fellow as
the scow.)</p>

<p class='c019'>“Get away from here yourself,” was the
report. “I was here first, an’ I’m going to
stay.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I’ll bet you will,” said <i>Bushboy</i>. (That
was the name of the boat Joe and his chums
hired at Indian Lake.) “But you may be
sure of one thing: You will stay a wreck.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“That’s so,” said I. “Joe Wayring will
never go away leaving him above the water.
He’ll break him up so completely that his thief
of a master won’t know him if he should happen
along this way again.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“He will never come this way again until he
is on his road to jail,” said <i>Wanderer</i>. “Mr.
Swan is after him, and he’s going to catch
him, too.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>“Wal, Matt’ll go to jail knowin’ that he’s
done a right smart of damage sence he’s been
layin’ around loose in the woods, an’ if I am
busted up, I shall have the same comfortin’
knowledge. Fly-rod has seed me afore. I
captured his friend, the canvas canoe—”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Where is he now?” I interrupted.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Out there in the bresh, hid away so snug
that nobody won’t ever find him,” was the
taunting reply. “Them guns is hid out there
too, but not in the same place. Matt come
purty near gettin’ you as well as the canoe. I
heard him say that he almost overtook Joe
while he was a runnin’ through the woods with
you in his hand.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Yes; and Matt would have got me over
the head if he had been able to run a little
faster.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“An’ Joe would have got a hickory over the
back, I tell you,” said the old scow. “How
do you reckon that that skiff I sent to the
bottom of the pond feels by this time?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“You didn’t send him to the bottom of the
pond,” said I, angrily. “You tried hard
enough, but you didn’t make it.”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>The bait-rods and the boats took up the
quarrel, and while I listened, I waited impatiently
for the return of the hunting party.
Presently I heard a slight rustling in the thicket
at the head of the bay, but it was not made by
the persons I wanted to see. It was Matt Coyle
that stuck his ugly face out of the bushes, and
his bleared and blood-shot eyes that traveled
from one to another of the boats that lay before
him. Then he turned and whispered to some one
behind him and the whole family came and stood
upon the bank. Their sudden appearance made
it plain to all of us that the squatter and his
backers, after “scattering like so many quails,”
had run just far enough in different directions
to bewilder their pursuers, after which they
“circled around” and came back to the bay,
intending to continue their flight in the scow,
which would leave no trail that could be followed.
It was evident, too, that there had
been an understanding among them before they
separated; otherwise they would not all have
been there. When Matt’s gaze rested upon the
trim little boats before him, he said in a low but
distinct voice—</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>“Whoop-ee! Jest look at all them nice
skiffs, will you? Ain’t we in luck though?
Never mind the scow. She’s done good work
fur us, but we’ll leave her behind now an’
travel like other white folks do. Old woman,
you go round to all them boats an’ pick up the
grub what’s into ’em; Jakey, you an’ Sam
ketch up the poles an’ cookin’ things an’ every
other article you can get your two hands onto.
Dump them that’ll sink into the water an’
chuck them that won’t sink as fur into the
bresh as you can, so’t they won’t never find’ em
no more. While you are doin’ that, I’ll pick
out two of the best boats fur our own.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Say, pap, what’s the reason we don’t carry
off the things in place of throwin’ on ’em away
or sinkin’ ’em?” asked Jake.</p>

<p class='c019'>“’Cause we can’t sell ’em, an’ we don’t
want to be bothered with totin’ ’em. You will
save time if you do jest as I told you. We
want to get away from here as sudden as we
can.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“An’ what’ll we do with the boats that we
don’t take with us?” continued Jake. “Will
we bust ’em up?”</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>“Now, jest listen at the fule!” exclaimed
Matt, angrily. “The noise we would make in
bustin’ on ’em up would bring ole Swan back
here a runnin’; an’ I don’t care to see him
with all them other fellers at his back.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The vagabonds worked with surprising celerity,
and in a very short space of time two of
the finest boats in the lot had been pushed into
the water, and the old woman was piling provisions
into them by the armful, while Jake
and Sam busied themselves in disposing of the
other things as their sire had directed. I was
sent whirling through the air toward the opposite
side of the bay, and sad to relate, was
stopped in my headlong flight by a tree, against
which I struck with a sounding whack. There
was a loud snap, and I fell to the ground helpless.
My second joint was broken close to the
ferrule.</p>

<p class='c019'>I lay for a long time where I had fallen—so
long that I began to wonder if I was to remain
there until my ferrules were all rusted to pieces
and I became like the mold beneath me. I
heard Matt and his family leave the bay in the
stolen boats. I knew when they forced their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>way through the bushes into the creek, and
was greatly astonished to know that they
turned down stream toward the pond, the direction
in which their pursuers would have to
go when they returned to the hotel. But Matt,
the sly old fox, had reasoned with himself on
this point before he adopted these extraordinary
tactics. It lacked only about half an hour
of night-fall, and Mr. Swan and his party would
soon be obliged to go into camp; while Matt
knowing every crook and turn in the creek,
could travel as well in the dark as he could by
daylight. Before the sun arose, he would be
miles away and among friends. If Mr. Swan
took it for granted that he had gone up instead
of down stream, and went that way himself in
hope of being able to overtake him, it would
give the squatter just so much more time in
which to make good his escape. It was a very
neat trick on Matt’s part.</p>

<p class='c019'>At last, after a long interval of waiting, I
heard voices and footsteps on the other side of
the bay. The birds having flown there was no
need of caution, and some of the returning
party were talking in their ordinary tones,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>while others were shouting back at their
friends in the rear. My acute sense of hearing
told me when they came out of the bushes, and
I also caught the exclamations of rage and
astonishment that fell from their lips when
they saw what had been done in the bay during
their brief absence. The guides were almost
beside themselves with fury, but the two city
sportsmen laughed uproariously.</p>

<p class='c019'>“We’re a pretty set, I must say,” I heard
one of them exclaim. “If I hadn’t seen it with
my own eyes, I never should have believed that
any man living could play a trick like this
upon us. Two of the best boats, all the rods,
provisions and dishes, as well as the frying-pans
are gone. I think we had better camp
right where we are, start for home at the first
peep of day and never show our faces in the
woods again.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Hallo! What’s this here?” cried one of
the guides, who, for want of something better
to do, had stepped into the skiff and shoved
out into the bay. He looked down into the
clear waters as he spoke, then seized the
boathook, and after a little maneuvering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>with it, brought one of the frying-pans to
light.</p>

<p class='c019'>“And what’s that over there on the other
side?” exclaimed the familiar voice of Mr.
Swan.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Why, it’s my unlucky bait-rod, as sure as
the world,” said Arthur Hastings. “But he
was lucky this time, wasn’t he? If he hadn’t
lodged in the friendly branches of that evergreen,
I should have thought that Matt Coyle
had carried him off again.”</p>

<p class='c019'>These unexpected discoveries led to a thorough
examination of the bay and of the bushes surrounding
it, and the result was most satisfactory.
Before dark every single article that Jake
and Sam had thrown away, had been recovered.
There was nothing missing now except the boats
and the provisions; but the loss of these things
did not put the party to any great inconvenience.
There was an abundance of game in
the woods, plenty of fish to be had for the
catching, and Matt’s scow could easily carry
the four men who had lost their skiffs.</p>

<p class='c019'>But little more remains to be told. Mr.
Swan and his party camped “right where they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>were” that night, made an early start the next
morning, and reached Indian Lake on the afternoon
of the following day. The chums found
their skiff in the best possible condition, and
looking very nobby in her new dress, by which
I mean a fresh coat of paint. They gave it
another day in which to dry, then laid in a
supply of provisions and fearlessly turned
their faces toward the wilderness; while the
two city sportsmen, thoroughly disgusted with
their failure, and by the trick that Matt had
so neatly played upon them, set out for home
declaring that they would never visit Indian
Lake again until their guns had been restored
to them, and the man who stole them was
safely lodged in jail.</p>

<p class='c019'>During the next few days I had nothing to
do but make myself miserable while the other
rods caught the fish that were served up three
times a day until the boys grew tired of them.
I was glad when Joe said that it was time to
start for home, but sorry for the disappointment
he met when he got there. Uncle Joe,
who was to have taken them upon an extended
tour, “either East or West, they didn’t know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>which,” had suddenly been called away on
important business, and the probabilities were
that if they took their contemplated trip at all
it would not be until near the end of the vacation;
and then it would have to be a very short
one. But Joe didn’t get sulky, as some boys
would have done under like circumstances.
He wrote to his uncle, found out when he was
coming home, and suggested an immediate
return to Indian Lake. Arthur and Roy were
delighted with the proposal, and I was at once
given into the hands of a skilled mechanic, who
in two days’ time mended my broken joint so
neatly that no one could tell, even with the
closest scrutiny, that there had ever been any
thing the matter with it. Joe came after me
on the afternoon of the second day, and when
he carried me to his room and stood me in the
corner where I was to stay until something
that he called “ferrule cement” had had time
to harden, whom should I see but my old friend,
the canvas canoe, occupying his usual place in
the recess, and looking none the worse for his
forced sojourn among the Indian Lake vagabonds.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>“Well, I swan to man!” I exclaimed,
unconsciously making use of an expression
which I had heard so often that I had
become quite familiar with it. “How in the
name of all that’s wonderful did you get
back?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Glad to see you, old fellow,” replied the
canoe, in his jolly, hearty fashion, “but sorry
to hear that you got crippled. Where have
you been?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Just got back from the doctor’s shop. I
am all right again, or shall be in a few days.
When and how did you return?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Came yesterday. Mr. Swan brought me.
Found me hidden under a pile of brush, not
more than twenty feet from the place where he
and his party stood when they burned the
squatter’s shanty. I saw and heard every thing
that happened there.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Well, tell us all about it. I know you must
have had some adventures during your
absence.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Indeed I have; and I have brought a heavy
load of anxiety back with me. How I wish I
could warn Joe and his chums! The threats I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>heard made against them were enough to make
even a canvas canoe shudder.”</p>

<p class='c019'>With these preliminary remarks the canoe
settled himself for an all-night’s task. I have
not space enough in this book to repeat what
he said, and besides, the narrative of my
exploits, which so far are neither many nor
brilliant I confess, is ended for the time being;
so I will gladly step aside and give place to my
accommodating friend, who is a more experienced
story-teller than myself, and who, in the
second volume of this series, will describe
many interesting and some exciting incidents
which happened during his captivity. His
story will be entitled: <span class='sc'>The Adventures of A
Canvas Canoe</span>.</p>

</div>

<p class='c020'>Neither as a writer does he stand apart from the great
currents of life and select some exceptional phase or odd
combination of circumstances. He stands on the common
level and appeals to the universal heart, and all that he suggests
or achieves is on the plane and in the line of march of
the great body of humanity.</p>

<p class='c019'>The Jack Hazard series of stories, published in the late
<i>Our Young Folks</i>, and continued in the first volume of <i>St.
Nicholas</i>, under the title of “Fast Friends,” is no doubt
destined to hold a high place in this class of literature. The
delight of the boys in them (and of their seniors, too) is
well founded. They go to the right spot every time. Trowbridge
knows the heart of a boy like a book, and the heart
of a man, too, and he has laid them both open in these books
in a most successful manner. Apart from the qualities that
render the series so attractive to all young readers, they
have great value on account of their portraitures of American
country life and character. The drawing is wonderfully
accurate, and as spirited as it is true. The constable, Sellick,
is an original character, and as minor figures where will
we find anything better than Miss Wansey, and Mr. P. Pipkin,
Esq. The picture of Mr. Dink’s school, too, is capital,
and where else in fiction is there a better nick-name than
that the boys gave to poor little Stephen Treadwell, “Step
Hen,” as he himself pronounced his name in an unfortunate
moment when he saw it in print for the first time in his lesson
in school.</p>

<p class='c019'>On the whole, these books are very satisfactory, and
afford the critical reader the rare pleasure of the works that
are just adequate, that easily fulfill themselves and accomplish
all they set out to do.—<i>Scribner’s Monthly.</i></p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
